This website presents Thich Nhat Hanh's talk at Google in 2011. It aims to increase its accessibility by providing a structured, synchronised transcript. 

http://mgrf.de/thayTalk/

The video files are not included in this repository. If they are not found locally, they are fetched from the above website (or mirrors).

You can easily make changes to the transcript by appending #edit to your url, e.g.:

http://mgrf.de/thayTalk/#edit

You can download the edited transcript with CTRL+SHIFT+S. If the server is set up with uploadTranscript.php, you can also save it directly with CTRL+S.

The source transcript aligns every word with the video. Hitting "O" in edit mode will reduce (flatten) the alignment to word groups. The result can be exported as subtitles by hitting "P".
