</span><ol><li><span start="5482.37" end="5487.49">The 1. element of true love is <b>loving kindness, Maitrī</b>. </span><span start="5489.44" end="5493.16">That is the capacity to make another person happy. </span><span start="5496.49" end="5498.61">And we have already learned that, </span><span start="5500.14" end="5502.72">if we cannot make ourselves peaceful, </span><span start="5502.81" end="5506.83">fresh, and happy, we cannot make another person happy. </span><span start="5508.42" end="5512.58">The practise of mindfulness helps restore solidity, </span><span start="5513.31" end="5516.65">freedom, piece, and freshness to us, </span><span start="5517.64" end="5518.65">so that we can, </span><span start="5520" end="5523.11">we have the capacity to make the other person happy.</span></li>
<li><span start="5524.54" end="5530.93">The 2. element of true love is <b>compassion, Karuṇā</b>. </span><span start="5532.38" end="5535.85">That capacity of understanding the suffering </span><span start="5536.58" end="5538.32">and help remove it. </span><span start="5539.29" end="5540.26">If you love someone, </span><span start="5541.12" end="5543.73">you should understand the suffering in him or in her, </span><span start="5544.87" end="5548.75">and you should be able to help transform that, remove that. </span><span start="5551.16" end="5554.14">And that you can do only after you have done it for you. </span><span start="5555.29" end="5557.94">You have fear, anger, despair in you, </span><span start="5558.21" end="5561.01">and if you do not know how to transform it, </span><span start="5561.41" end="5563.89">how can you help your beloved one to do the same? </span><span start="5564.99" end="5567.44">So understanding the suffering inside, </span><span start="5568.9" end="5571.46">and bring a relief and transformation, </span><span start="5571.55" end="5572.88">is very crucial for love. </span><span start="5574.23" end="5577.15">And then you will be able to help your beloved one </span><span start="5579.44" end="5581.56">transform the suffering. </span><span start="5583.93" end="5586.18">So that is the 2. element of true love: </span><span start="5588.92" end="5593.37">the capacity to help someone suffer less.</span></li>
<li><span start="5597.15" end="5600.69">And the 3. element of true love is <b>joy</b> (<b>Muditā</b>), </span><span start="5601.35" end="5606.39">because true love always generate joy for you </span><span start="5606.5" end="5607.78">and for the other person. </span><span start="5609.37" end="5614.59">If both of us cry during the process of loving, </span><span start="5614.7" end="5615.73">that is not true love. </span><span start="5616.77" end="5621.33">True love should bring joy every moment of our daily life. </span><span start="5622.52" end="5628.11">And mindfulness can help doing that.</span></li>
<li><span start="5630.44" end="5636.72">And the 4. element of true love is <b>inclusiveness</b> (<b>Upekṣā</b>). </span><span start="5637.96" end="5638.78">In true love, </span><span start="5639.65" end="5641.67">there is no longer any frontier between </span><span start="5641.67" end="5643.24">you and your beloved one. </span><span start="5644.14" end="5646.04">Your suffering is his suffering. </span><span start="5647.67" end="5650.08">His happiness is your happiness. </span><span start="5652.89" end="5656.45">And there is a perfect way of understanding </span><span start="5656.51" end="5657.75">between the two of you. </span><span start="5659.36" end="5662.93">And together you can serve and help many people. </span><span start="5663.93" end="5667.6">True love is the kind of love that always grows. </span><span start="5670.56" end="5671.67">It has no frontier. </span><span start="5673.31" end="5674.69">And practising true love, </span><span start="5676.45" end="5683.25">you begin to <i>embrace everyone</i>, the whole planet, </span><span start="5684.18" end="5685.97">and bring a lot of joy to you.</span></li></ol>
<span start="5687.86" end="5691.19">And that is why we have to know where we go. </span><span start="5694.09" end="5696.02">If love is our destination, </span><span start="5696.52" end="5699.47">and then we have to <b>sacrifice other things</b>, </span><span start="5699.55" end="5701.58">that are not love, like:

<span start="5710.92" end="5712.11">Because there are those, </span><span start="5712.11" end="5716.42">who have plenty of these things, and who suffer very deeply.</span><br/>

<span start="5721.83" end="5730.04">And when I was ordained as a monk at the age of 16, </span><span start="5732.93" end="5735.68">my teacher gave me the <b>Dharma name</b><b>: </b></span><span start="5735.72" end="5737.18"><span><b>Nhất Hạnh</b></span>, which means: </span><span start="5738.58" end="5740.79"><i>one action</i> - you do only one thing. </span><span start="5742.76" end="5748.42">You don't do many things at the same time - <b>mono-tasking</b>. </span><span start="5755.6" end="5760.56">And I tried to live according to this teaching. </span><span start="5762.96" end="5765.05">I want to transform myself. </span><span start="5766.67" end="5768.24">I want to help people be happy. </span><span start="5769.9" end="5772.14">Because I know that, if people are happy, </span><span start="5772.17" end="5773.53">I can be happy also. </span><span start="5776.37" end="5787.31">And that is why <b>Buddhist meditation is made of 2 elements</b>: </span><span start="5788.08" end="5792.08">the 1. element is <b>concentration</b>. </span><span start="5796.19" end="5799.62">You focus your attention just on one thing. </span><span start="5803.33" end="5805.44">Otherwise your concentration is not </span><span start="5806.8" end="5811.68">powerful enough to get a breakthrough, and get a insight. </span><span start="5814.77" end="5816.04">And concentration can be practised, </span><span start="5818.03" end="5821.46">not by thinking, but by:

well - I lose something. </span><span start="7915.78" end="7920.42">My experience was kind deep spiritual experience, </span><span start="7920.42" end="7924.54">I wanted to keep by myself, to keep it long. </span><span start="7926.01" end="7934.16">And later on, when I grew up, <b>I had the hope</b><b>, <span start="7934.16" end="7937.13">that everyone I meet will have the chance to </span></b></span><span start="7937.13" end="7942.58"><span><b>meet his hermit</b></span> also in their lifetime. </span><span start="7943.41" end="7945.69">Maybe you have met your hermit, </span><span start="7946.02" end="7947.53">but you have not recognised him. </span><span start="7948.84" end="7950.47">Your hermit may not be a well, </span><span start="7950.92" end="7956.59">but may be a rock, or a tree, or a child, or a mountain. </span><span start="7957.59" end="7960.54">But once you have got the hermit, you know where to go. </span><span start="7961.14" end="7962.78">And you begin your spiritual life, </span><span start="7963.28" end="7967.68">that can help you to overcome difficulties and find peace. </span><span start="7968.4" end="7972.55">And that is one of the stories I like to tell children, </span><span start="7972.55" end="7974.79">who come to Plum Village to practise.</span><br/>
