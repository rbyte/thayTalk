00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:09.414
Dear friends, in Plum Village France, 

2
00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.219
where we live and practise, 

3
00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.019
every time we hear the sound of the bell, 

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.947
we stop our thinking, we stop our talking, 

5
00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:24.626
and we go back to our in-breath, 

6
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:32.957
and breathe mindfully - and at least 3 times. 

7
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.338
In. 

8
00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:37.206
Out. 

9
00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:42.245
And that practise is called listening 

10
00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:47.098
to the bell of mindfulness. 

11
00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:58.604
When you hear the bell, you naturally stop your thinking. 

12
00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.170
It has become a habit. 

13
00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.545
You naturally stop your thinking, 

14
00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:10.484
and you focus your attention on your in-breath, 

15
00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.683
and you enjoy breathing in. 

16
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.905
And when you breathe in mindfully like that, 

17
00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:21.707
you bring your mind home to your body. 

18
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.846
And you become fully alive in the here and the now. 

19
00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:33.299
It takes only 3 seconds 

20
00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.155
in order to bring the mind home to the body, 

21
00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:42.059
and establish ourselves in the here and the now. 

22
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.204
And when your are well established in the here and the now, 

23
00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:51.185
you can get in touch with life. 

24
00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:52.810
First of all (5 Skandhas):

25
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.799
your body (rūpa),

26
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.010
your feelings (vedanā),

27
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.141
your perceptions (samjñā),

28
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.554
your mental formations (samskāra),

29
00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:05.965
your consciousness (vijñāna).

30
00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:10.870
And you get in touch with the wonders of life around you. 

31
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:24.169
The energy of mindfulness has the power to heal, 

32
00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.310
to transform.

33
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.500
When you love someone, 

34
00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:51.853
you have the tendency to offer him or her something. 

35
00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.960
You want to make him or her happy. 

36
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:09.460
And you are inhabited by the energy of love. 

37
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.814
And that is why 

38
00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:20.639
you have the desire to make him or her happy. 

39
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.645
As I have said, love has the power to heal, 

40
00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:33.659
to nourish, to bring happiness, and to transform suffering. 

41
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.150
And the practise of mindfulness can produce love. 

42
00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.894
The real elements of true love can be 

43
00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:54.364
produced by the practise of mindfulness. 

44
00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:57.639
And when you have that love in you, 

45
00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.854
you are alive, you are peaceful, 

46
00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:08.439
you are happy, and you can make the other person happy. 

47
00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.340
Usually, when we want to make the other person happy, 

48
00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.826
we want to give him or her something. 

49
00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.625
We may write a poem for him, for her. 

50
00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:36.065
Or we may cook something good and give to him or to her. 

51
00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:39.689
Or you may go to the market and buy something. 

52
00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.629
But the most precious thing you can give him or her, 

53
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.330
is not something you can buy from the market, 

54
00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:59.274
it is not something that you can buy with money - 

55
00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:02.579
it is your true presence. 

56
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.934
You have to be there for him and for her, 

57
00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:12.999
if you truly love him or her. 

58
00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:15.959
And in order to be there, 

59
00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.814
you need the practise of mindfulness. 

60
00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:29.285
And what you want to offer your beloved one is 

61
00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.399
your true presence. 

62
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.535
How can you love, if you are not there? 

63
00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:43.070
True love means to be there for him or for her. 

64
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.692
And to be there is a practise.

65
00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:50.485
In the Buddhist tradition, 

66
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:56.220
when you begin to breathe in mindfully, 

67
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.355
you bring your mind home to your body. 

68
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:08.533
And when mind and body are together, you are truly there. 

69
00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:12.425
In our daily life, very often, 

70
00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:16.589
our body is there, but our mind is not there. 

71
00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:20.624
We are not truly there. 

72
00:06:20.674 --> 00:06:24.980
It is impossible to love, if you are not there. 

73
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.305
So practise mindful breathing, 

74
00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.790
bring your mind home to your body, 

75
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.357
can help you to be there. 

76
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:43.660
Our in-breath, our out-breath, 

77
00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:48.301
is something like a bridge linking mind and body. 

78
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.775
And the moment when we pay attention to our in-breath, 

79
00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:53.615
and breathe in mindfully, 

80
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:56.100
we bring our mind home to our body, 

81
00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:01.278
and we are there - in just 2 or 3 seconds. 

82
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:07.742
And you can go to your beloved one, 

83
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:13.697
looking in his or her eyes, and you can say: 

84
00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:16.125
Darling, I am here for you.

85
00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:19.240
Your presence is the most precious gift, 

86
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.461
that you can make to your beloved one.

87
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:35.805
There is an 11-year old boy, who is unhappy, 

88
00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.710
because his father is not there for him. 

89
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.339
His father is a very rich businessman, 

90
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.353
successful businessman too. 

91
00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:52.834
But he does not have time for himself, 

92
00:07:52.884 --> 00:08:00.480
for his wife, and his son. 

93
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.598
That day he said: 

94
00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:09.420
My son, tomorrow will be your birthday, right? 

95
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:11.584
Do you want anything? 

96
00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:13.600
I will buy it for you.

97
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.075
The young man did not know how to answer. 

98
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.665
He did not need anything. 

99
00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:26.560
His father can afford to buy anything he wanted, 

100
00:08:26.609 --> 00:08:29.250
but he did not need anything. 

101
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.439
He needed one thing. 

102
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.990
The presence of his father. 

103
00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.575
From time to time is father is there at home, 

104
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:42.135
but his mind is not with his body. 

105
00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:45.710
So the young man has the impression, 

106
00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.879
that he does not really have a father. 

107
00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:51.884
So after some reflection he said: 

108
00:08:51.935 --> 00:08:56.259
Daddy, it is you that I want!

109
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.944
And if the father knows the practise of mindful breathing, 

110
00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:08.105
he will begin to breathe in mindfully, 

111
00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:11.940
and it takes only 3 seconds for him to be there - 

112
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.735
body and mind together. 

113
00:09:13.784 --> 00:09:16.490
And looking into the eyes of his son he said: 

114
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.639
Darling, I am here for you.

115
00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:20.460
It is very easy. 

116
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:23.076
Everyone can do that.

117
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:32.310
To me, to love means to be there for your beloved one. 

118
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.529
And to be there, for me, is not a willing intention, 

119
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.589
a desire, that is a practise. 

120
00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:45.595
In order to be there, you need to breathe in mindfully, 

121
00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:47.982
and bring your mind home to your body. 

122
00:09:48.032 --> 00:09:52.115
Or you may like to practise walking meditation, 

123
00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:54.144
mindful walking. 

124
00:09:54.194 --> 00:10:02.904
While breathing in you make 1 step or 2 steps. 

125
00:10:02.954 --> 00:10:08.159
And you become aware of the step you make. 

126
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:14.490
You are touching life in the present moment with your foot. 

127
00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:20.335
One step alone can bring you home to the here and the now, 

128
00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:23.779
and be fully present in the here and the now. 

129
00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:28.835
There are many ways of practise, that 

130
00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:31.610
can help bring our mind home to the body, 

131
00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:36.698
so that we can be established in the here and the now.

132
00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:53.840
When you breathe in mindfully, 

133
00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:57.360
and look at a flower like this one. 

134
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.935
You have an opportunity to get in touch with 

135
00:11:04.985 --> 00:11:08.350
this flower deeply. 

136
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.270
You are mindful that the flower is there. 

137
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.879
Mindfulness is the kind of energy, 

138
00:11:20.929 --> 00:11:25.300
that allows us to know what is there, 

139
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.061
what is happening in the here and the now. 

140
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:31.072
When you practise mindful breathing, 

141
00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:34.944
the object of your mindfulness is your in-breath. 

142
00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.185
Your in-breath is something that 

143
00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:40.696
is happening in the here and the now. 

144
00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:49.335
And you may like to enjoy your in-breath also. 

145
00:11:49.384 --> 00:11:51.884
When you breath-in, 

146
00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:55.085
and using the energy of mindfulness 

147
00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:56.990
generated by your in-breath, 

148
00:11:57.039 --> 00:12:02.110
you can recognise that flower as existing. 

149
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.210
And you get in touch with that flower. 

150
00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:09.340
And if your mindfulness is strong enough, 

151
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:13.595
powerful enough, you are concentrated on the flower, 

152
00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:15.625
and you get the insight: 

153
00:12:15.675 --> 00:12:21.309
that that flower is a wonder, a wonder! 

154
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:29.884
And you may see that the 

155
00:12:29.934 --> 00:12:33.413
flower belongs to the kingdom of god, 

156
00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:36.360
or the pure land of the Buddha.

157
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:43.838
And when you get in touch with flower, 

158
00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:47.177
you get in touch with the kingdom of god. 

159
00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:50.467
And you get in touch with god, 

160
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.629
because god is always with his kingdom. 

161
00:13:01.216 --> 00:13:03.923
And you may get the insight, 

162
00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:05.634
that the kingdom of god is 

163
00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:08.598
available in the here and the now. 

164
00:13:08.648 --> 00:13:11.259
You don't have to look for it 

165
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.600
in the future or somewhere else. 

166
00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:18.830
You don't need to die in order to go to the kingdom. 

167
00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:22.962
In fact, you have to be very alive in order to do so. 

168
00:13:23.013 --> 00:13:27.043
And to be alive, to be fully present in the here and the now, 

169
00:13:27.092 --> 00:13:31.009
you need only to breath-in mindfully, 

170
00:13:31.058 --> 00:13:33.923
and it takes 2 or 3 seconds. 

171
00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:38.590
So the kingdom of god is available to you, 

172
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:44.730
because you have the power, the capacity of being mindful. 

173
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.431
And the insight you get is: 

174
00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:52.254
the kingdom is available in the here and the now. 

175
00:13:52.304 --> 00:13:54.754
And you would like to make yourself 

176
00:13:54.804 --> 00:13:57.337
available to the kingdom. 

177
00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:01.492
And to make yourself available to the kingdom, 

178
00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:03.764
that can be done very quickly: 

179
00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:09.250
just breathe in mindfully, or making a step mindfully.

180
00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:15.260
And then when you practise: 

181
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.129
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

182
00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:22.519
This is the 3. exercise 

183
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.274
recommended by the Buddha in the Sutra of Mindful 

184
00:14:25.324 --> 00:14:26.542
Breathing (Ānāpānasati Sutta): 

185
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:31.860
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

186
00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:35.002
Mindfulness of the body. 

187
00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:38.304
You know that your body is there. 

188
00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.436
And while breathing in like that, 

189
00:14:40.485 --> 00:14:44.109
you bring you mind home to your body - and there you are: 

190
00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:47.649
alive, present. 

191
00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:49.346
And you may discover, 

192
00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:55.645
that your body also belongs to the kingdom of god. 

193
00:14:55.695 --> 00:15:02.480
Your body, like that flower, is a wonder. 

194
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:11.103
And you can touch the kingdom of god also in your body. 

195
00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:15.980
You don't have to go far, and in the future, 

196
00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:21.965
in order to get in touch with the kingdom of god. 

197
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:31.190
Mindfulness allowed us to be alive 

198
00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:35.928
and to touch the wonders of life, 

199
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:39.065
inside of us, and around us. 

200
00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:44.399
And many of these wonders have the power to heal, 

201
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.269
to nourish. 

202
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.799
And you don't have to go to a temple 

203
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.517
in order to practise mindfulness. 

204
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.830
Walking from the parking lot to your office, 

205
00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:05.415
you may enjoy the practise of mindful walking, 

206
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:09.177
you may like to enjoy every step, 

207
00:16:11.044 --> 00:16:13.882
touching the wonders of live. 

208
00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:17.600
That is something all of us can do.

209
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:24.519
Years ago, we offered a retreat for congressman in Washington DC. 

210
00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:28.335
They have a hectic life. 

211
00:16:28.384 --> 00:16:34.779
And they need the practise of mindfulness in order to release the tension, 

212
00:16:35.096 --> 00:16:50.919
to relax, and to be in touch with life. 

213
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.149
Years after the retreat, 

214
00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:05.589
they continued to practise mindful walking, 

215
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.674
and several of them wrote us, 

216
00:17:11.725 --> 00:17:13.734
and said that from their office, 

217
00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:16.460
where they work, to the place where they cast their vote, 

218
00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:20.789
they always practise mindful walking 

219
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:27.579
and stop all thinking - just walking. 

220
00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:32.504
And they say, 

221
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:38.650
that they survive that hectic life just by mindful walking.

222
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:44.269
So from the parking lot to your office, 

223
00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:46.255
you may like to do like that: 

224
00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:54.740
you stop all your thinking, and you enjoy every step. 

225
00:17:54.789 --> 00:18:02.480
Walk in such a way, that every step can bring you freedom, 

226
00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:13.759
can bring you solidity, freedom and healing. 

227
00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:19.224
Many of us use the practise of mindful 

228
00:18:19.275 --> 00:18:21.849
walking to heal ourselves. 

229
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.259
When you breathe in mindfully, 

230
00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:29.914
and focus your attention on your breath, 

231
00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:32.240
when you make a step mindfully, 

232
00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:35.055
and focus your attention on your step, 

233
00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:38.819
you release the past, you release the future, 

234
00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:41.259
you release all your projects, 

235
00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:44.954
because your mind has only one object: 

236
00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:50.589
that is your in-breath, or your step. 

237
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.585
One in-breath or one step can set you free! 

238
00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:59.950
Free from the worries and the uncertainties 

239
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.654
about the future, 

240
00:19:01.704 --> 00:19:07.095
free from the regret and the sorrow concerning the past. 

241
00:19:07.144 --> 00:19:12.384
The past may a prison, the future may be a prison, 

242
00:19:12.435 --> 00:19:18.870
if you are subjected to regret, sorrow, fear, uncertainty. 

243
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.545
But when you focus your attention on your in-breath, 

244
00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.549
you release everything. 

245
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.605
So one breath, one in-breath, set you free, 

246
00:19:28.654 --> 00:19:32.095
one step made in mindfulness set you free. 

247
00:19:32.144 --> 00:19:33.940
And when you are free, 

248
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.805
your body has regained its power to heal itself. 

249
00:19:38.855 --> 00:19:41.970
And your mind also.

250
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.710
I have said in the beginning that, 

251
00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.394
when you love someone, 

252
00:19:51.444 --> 00:19:56.714
you would like to offer him or her the best thing you have. 

253
00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:59.164
The best thing, the most precious thing you have, 

254
00:19:59.214 --> 00:20:01.319
is your presence. 

255
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.640
But your presence may have a higher quality:


256
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.274
you are fresh,

257
00:20:09.325 --> 00:20:10.569
you are free,

258
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.559
you are solid,

259
00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:15.345
you are happy.

260
00:20:15.394 --> 00:20:18.980
And the practise of mindfulness helps you 

261
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:25.539
to retain your freshness, to cultivate more peace, 

262
00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:29.549
more solidity.

263
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:36.914
There is a practise for children called Pebo[?] Meditation. 

264
00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:39.704
There are 4 Pebos. 

265
00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:42.829
And children practise like this:


266
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.929
The 1. Pebo represents a flower. 

267
00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.584
Breathing in, I see myself as a flower. 

268
00:20:53.634 --> 00:20:57.130
Breathing out, I feel fresh.

269
00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:03.480
The human being is a kind of flower. 

270
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:11.650
And if we do not know how to practise, 

271
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.284
and then we will lose our freshness, 

272
00:21:15.335 --> 00:21:20.420
and we do not have much to offer the person we love. 

273
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.974
So practising mindful breathing or 

274
00:21:24.025 --> 00:21:28.285
walking can restore your freshness, your flowerness. 

275
00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:30.075
It is something possible. 

276
00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:33.524
Releasing the worries, the fear, the anger, 

277
00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:36.244
and restore your freshness. 

278
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:41.640
It is something that we can do, while sitting or walking. 

279
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.244
The children practise: 

280
00:21:45.295 --> 00:21:48.824
Breathing in, I see myself as a flower.

281
00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.564
You don't have to imagine ourselves as a flower, 

282
00:21:51.615 --> 00:21:57.625
because the human body, the human being, is very beautiful. 

283
00:21:57.674 --> 00:21:59.670
It is real flower. 

284
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.085
Look at a child. 

285
00:22:01.134 --> 00:22:03.029
Look at her face. 

286
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:09.204
Her tiny hand, his tiny foot, is a real flower. 

287
00:22:09.255 --> 00:22:11.599
It is beautiful when the child sleeps, 

288
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.149
it is beautiful when the child is awake and plays. 

289
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.839
And we are born as flowers. 

290
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.634
And it is possible for us to preserve our flowerness, 

291
00:22:26.685 --> 00:22:34.180
our freshness, our beauty.

292
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.835
The 2. Pebo: 

293
00:22:36.884 --> 00:22:41.220
Breathing in, I see myself as a mountain.

294
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.569
A mountain represents stability and solidity. 

295
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.714
A person cannot be a happy person unless 

296
00:22:53.765 --> 00:22:59.599
she has some stability, he has some stability. 

297
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.835
And the practise of mindful breathing, 

298
00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:05.910
mindful sitting, 

299
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.950
mindful walking can always help us to 

300
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.400
cultivate more stability and solidity. 

301
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.584
And our solidity, 

302
00:23:16.634 --> 00:23:19.650
our stability is something we can offer 

303
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.750
to the person we love. 

304
00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:29.974
If we are too unstable, if we are not solid, 

305
00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:32.650
we are not happy, 

306
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:38.730
and the other person suffers also because of that. 

307
00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:42.794
So cultivating stability and solidity is 

308
00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:44.779
something you can do.

309
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:51.309
Breathing in, I see myself as still water. 

310
00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:56.420
Breathing out, I reflect things as they truly are.

311
00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:02.900
When you are calm, you are not victims of wrong perceptions. 

312
00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:08.690
You are not victims of anger and fear, 

313
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.764
because you are calm enough. 

314
00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:13.529
You don't imagine things. 

315
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.470
So breathing in, breathing out, 

316
00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:26.924
or practising walking, you can cultivate peace, 

317
00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:29.879
calmness, tranquility. 

318
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:35.115
A person who does not have enough peace in himself, 

319
00:24:35.164 --> 00:24:39.529
herself, cannot be a happy person. 

320
00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:43.504
So cultivating peace in oneself is something 

321
00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:47.829
we can do with the practise of mindful breathing, 

322
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.309
mindful walking, mindful sitting. 

323
00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:56.105
And when you have peace in you, 

324
00:24:56.154 --> 00:24:59.880
you have something to offer him or her.

325
00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:05.880
Breathing in, I see myself as space. 

326
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.690
Breathing out, I feel free.

327
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:15.204
If we do not have enough space in our heart, 

328
00:25:15.255 --> 00:25:19.845
we have so much worries and fear and anger, 

329
00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:22.099
we are not happy. 

330
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.584
And that is why the practise is to bring 

331
00:25:24.634 --> 00:25:27.579
more space into our hearts and around us. 

332
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.449
A person cannot be a happy person unless 

333
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.855
she has some freedom, some space in herself or around her. 

334
00:25:37.904 --> 00:25:43.054
So to love means to offer space. 

335
00:25:43.105 --> 00:25:46.085
And if you do not have space in you, 

336
00:25:46.134 --> 00:25:49.724
how can you offer your beloved one this space?

337
00:25:49.775 --> 00:25:52.855
That is why the practise of mindfulness, 

338
00:25:52.904 --> 00:25:54.974
whether that is mindfulness of breathing, 

339
00:25:55.025 --> 00:26:01.474
or walking, or working, or eating, 

340
00:26:01.525 --> 00:26:11.740
always helps us cultivate these values, these energies. 

341
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:20.744
Or we can cultivate our beauty, our freshness. 

342
00:26:20.795 --> 00:26:27.625
We can cultivate more of our stability and solidity. 

343
00:26:27.674 --> 00:26:34.079
We can cultivate more the energy of peace, calmness. 

344
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.819
And we can always cultivate more 

345
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.230
the element of freedom in us. 

346
00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:47.734
So when you look at your beloved one, and you say: 

347
00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:50.154
Darling, I am here for you.

348
00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:52.000
that is great gift. 

349
00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:57.930
Because your presence has the element of freshness, 

350
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.055
of stability, of peace and of freedom - 

351
00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:08.400
the best kind of gift you can make to him or to her.

352
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:39.289
[Gong]

353
00:27:41.759 --> 00:27:46.084
That presence generated by the practise of mindfulness, 

354
00:27:46.134 --> 00:27:48.450
of breathing or walking - 

355
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.224
that presence is for you first, for us first, 

356
00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:56.295
and then for the other person. 

357
00:27:56.345 --> 00:27:59.419
We have to be truly present, 

358
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:05.059
because love always begins with oneself. 

359
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:10.440
If you are not capable of loving yourself, 

360
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.774
of taking care of yourself, 

361
00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:19.734
you will not have the capacity to love the other person, 

362
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:23.299
and take good take of him or her. 

363
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:28.054
And that is why loving oneself is the 

364
00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:31.289
foundation for loving the other person. 

365
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.994
And there are practises that everyone can 

366
00:28:35.045 --> 00:28:38.059
do in order to care for oneself, 

367
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.954
in order for us to be able to care 

368
00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:44.380
for the other person and for the world.

369
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.240
The Buddha proposed many easy, 

370
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:53.980
simple practises the everyone can do. 

371
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:59.159
Like the 1. exercise of mindful breathing: 

372
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.825
Breathing in, I know I am breathing in. 

373
00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:06.894
Breathing out, I know I am breathing out.

374
00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:10.434
You recognise your in-breath, 

375
00:29:10.485 --> 00:29:12.434
you recognise your out-breath, 

376
00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:15.865
and since you have your in-breath as the 

377
00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:18.200
object of your mind, you release everything else, 

378
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.454
you are free. 

379
00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:24.085
Very simple exercise and the effect is great: 

380
00:29:24.134 --> 00:29:29.490
it set you free, just 3, 4 seconds of breathing-in. 

381
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.339
And you don't need to practise 

382
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.980
many months and many years in order to see the effect. 

383
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:45.134
The first few minutes, when you begin the practise, 

384
00:29:45.184 --> 00:29:48.144
you can see the outcome right away. 

385
00:29:48.195 --> 00:29:52.575
Breathing in, if you pay attention only to your in-breath, 

386
00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:55.849
and then you can release, end the past, 

387
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.794
end the future, and all your projects. 

388
00:29:58.845 --> 00:30:04.949
And the process of healing begins, right away!

389
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.450
The 2. exercise of mindful breathing is: 

390
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.670
Breathing in, 

391
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.230
I follow my in-breath from the beginning to the end. 

392
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.420
I follow my in-breath all the way through.

393
00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:24.649
Your in-breath may only last for 3, 4, 

394
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.615
5 seconds, but while breathing in, 

395
00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:31.259
you are fully concentrated on your in-breath. 

396
00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:37.339
And you may enjoy breathing in, 

397
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.265
because breathing in is something enjoyable too. 

398
00:30:41.315 --> 00:30:45.190
You don't have to suffer while breathing in. 

399
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.339
If you suffer while breathing in, 

400
00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:54.569
you are not practising correctly. 

401
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.994
Because life is a lot of suffering already in life, 

402
00:30:58.045 --> 00:31:01.569
why do you have to practise in order to suffer more?! 

403
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:08.254
So, whether it is the practise of mindful breathing, 

404
00:31:08.305 --> 00:31:10.384
or mindful walking, mindful sitting, 

405
00:31:10.434 --> 00:31:16.130
we do it in such a way, to give you pleasure and happiness. 

406
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.759
The practise is pleasant, should be pleasant. 

407
00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:25.365
And when the energy of mindfulness and 

408
00:31:25.415 --> 00:31:27.194
concentration are powerful enough, 

409
00:31:27.245 --> 00:31:30.494
you always get an insight. 

410
00:31:30.545 --> 00:31:35.859
The insight can help liberate you from your afflictions, 

411
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:42.339
like fear, anger, jealousy, despair and so on.

412
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.480
There are 3 kinds of energies 

413
00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:50.339
that can be generated by the practise of mindfulness:


414
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:58.720
The 1. energy is mindfulness (Sati), 

415
00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:02.384
which allows us to become alive, 

416
00:32:02.434 --> 00:32:05.740
to become present in the here and the now, 

417
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:11.634
and to be aware of what is happening in 

418
00:32:11.685 --> 00:32:13.519
the here and the now.

419
00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:18.194
And the 2. kind of energy 

420
00:32:18.245 --> 00:32:20.529
is the energy of concentration (Samādhi). 

421
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.049
When you are very aware, 

422
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.690
when you are very mindful of something, 

423
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.125
you are naturally concentrated on that. 

424
00:32:29.174 --> 00:32:34.044
If you are aware, if you are mindful of your in-breath, 

425
00:32:34.095 --> 00:32:37.775
you will be concentrating on your in-breath. 

426
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:42.279
So that is the meaning of the 2. exercise: 

427
00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:48.259
Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through.

428
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:52.914
So mindfulness can become powerful 

429
00:32:52.965 --> 00:32:55.464
because of the concentration 

430
00:32:55.514 --> 00:32:59.474
that is born from the practise of mindfulness.

431
00:32:59.525 --> 00:33:03.700
And when mindfulness and concentration are together, 

432
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:09.544
are powerful enough, you always get the 3. energy: 

433
00:33:09.595 --> 00:33:12.240
the energy of insight (Paññā). 

434
00:33:16.109 --> 00:33:21.279
Insight in this case does not come from thinking, 

435
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.544
but from mindfulness. 

436
00:33:24.595 --> 00:33:26.809
And during the time 

437
00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.210
of practising mindfulness and concentration, 

438
00:33:29.259 --> 00:33:30.524
you don't need to think, 

439
00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:34.589
you may like to stop the thinking altogether. 

440
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:43.714
Insight is the outcome of non-thinking.

441
00:33:43.765 --> 00:33:50.344
When we breath in mindfully and with concentration, 

442
00:33:50.394 --> 00:33:52.644
we may discover many things. 

443
00:33:52.695 --> 00:33:56.265
We may discover the fact that we are alive. 

444
00:33:56.315 --> 00:34:01.279
Many do not know that they are alive. 

445
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.179
They are there, but they are not alive, 

446
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:12.500
because they do not have mindfulness. 

447
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.125
So there is a very simple exercise: 

448
00:34:17.174 --> 00:34:22.605
Breathing in - mindfully - I feel alive.

449
00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:24.315
And that is the truth. 

450
00:34:24.365 --> 00:34:29.809
If someone is not alive, she cannot breath in anymore. 

451
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.765
So breathing in mindfully, you get the insight, 

452
00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:37.664
that you are alive. 

453
00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:42.829
And to be alive is the most wonderful thing. 

454
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.960
It is a miracle. 

455
00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:48.800
It is the greatest of all miracles to be alive. 

456
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.710
And just 2 or 3 seconds breathing in can 

457
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.349
bring you that insight, that you are alive, 

458
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.255
and you touch the miracle of being alive. 

459
00:35:00.304 --> 00:35:03.715
And when you breath out you can celebrate 

460
00:35:03.764 --> 00:35:06.210
the fact that you are alive. 

461
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.284
So happiness is possible, joy is possible, 

462
00:35:10.335 --> 00:35:13.610
just by one in-breath and one out-breath, and 

463
00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:17.389
it is nourishing and healing.

464
00:35:22.409 --> 00:35:25.764
And breathing in mindfully 

465
00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:32.230
like that helps you to touch many conditions of happiness, 

466
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.884
that have the power to heal, 

467
00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:39.250
and to nourish in us and around us. 

468
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:45.570
Suppose we breath in and we become mindful of our heart: 

469
00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:50.199
Breathing in I am aware of my heart.

470
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.599
Generating the energy of mindfulness, 

471
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:59.194
you use that energy of mindfulness to recognise the 

472
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:01.299
presence your heart. 

473
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:05.989
You kind of embrace your heart with the energy of mindfulness. 

474
00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.315
And you can discover the fact, 

475
00:36:08.364 --> 00:36:13.429
that your heart still functions normally. 

476
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.469
That is already an insight. 

477
00:36:16.519 --> 00:36:18.954
And it is wonderful to have a heart that 

478
00:36:19.005 --> 00:36:21.315
still functions normally. 

479
00:36:21.364 --> 00:36:25.010
There are those of us who only wish for that. 

480
00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:28.980
And their deepest desire may be just having 

481
00:36:29.029 --> 00:36:31.864
a normal heart like that. 

482
00:36:31.914 --> 00:36:34.019
So breathing in, 

483
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.820
and having our heart as the object of our mindfulness, 

484
00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:41.139
we can feel grateful to our heart. 

485
00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:46.704
And that is one of the conditions of 

486
00:36:46.755 --> 00:36:49.329
happiness that we are having. 

487
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.125
And when the Buddha teaches 

488
00:36:54.175 --> 00:36:56.375
the practise of mindfulness of the body, 

489
00:36:56.424 --> 00:37:00.865
he advises us to get in touch with all parts of the body, 

490
00:37:00.914 --> 00:37:08.699
and smile and recognise these parts of the body.

491
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:19.295
There is an exercise of deep total relaxation that we 

492
00:37:19.345 --> 00:37:21.219
will try today. 

493
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.990
We put ourselves in the lying position, 

494
00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:30.835
and we begin to breath in and out mindfully, 

495
00:37:30.885 --> 00:37:33.849
and recognise parts of our body. 

496
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.534
Its like a scanning our body, not with X-ray, 

497
00:37:37.585 --> 00:37:40.114
but the ray of mindfulness. 

498
00:37:40.164 --> 00:37:44.030
You recognise your eyes. 

499
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:48.074
Breathing in, I am aware of my eyes. 

500
00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:52.010
Breathing out, I smile to my eyes.

501
00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:56.309
Recognising the presence of your eyes. 

502
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.855
And you may get the insight that - well - 

503
00:37:59.904 --> 00:38:03.449
my eyes are still in good conditions. 

504
00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:11.934
A paradise of forms and colours is available to me, 

505
00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:16.740
just because I still have eyes in good condition. 

506
00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:18.514
You need only to open your 

507
00:38:18.565 --> 00:38:24.045
eyes in order to touch the paradise of form and colour. 

508
00:38:24.095 --> 00:38:28.940
That is another condition of happiness.

509
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.500
And we go through the body, 

510
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.735
and we recognise every part of the body. 

511
00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:43.130
And when we come to a place that is a little bit ailing, 

512
00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:46.309
we may like to stop longer, 

513
00:38:46.359 --> 00:38:49.650
and embrace with compassion 

514
00:38:50.699 --> 00:38:57.400
and tenderness the part of the body that is ailing. 

515
00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.074
That practise of being aware of the body, 

516
00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:05.940
can help heal the body. 

517
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:11.144
You can still continue with your medicine, 

518
00:39:11.195 --> 00:39:16.539
but to relax our body, 

519
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.074
to embrace tenderly that part of your body 

520
00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:25.619
with mindfulness is a practise, can accelerate, 

521
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.505
can help very much the healing, 

522
00:39:28.554 --> 00:39:32.619
can make the healing happen more quickly. 

523
00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:35.820
The 3. exercise: 

524
00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:38.300
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

525
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:41.210
is part of that exercise. 

526
00:39:41.259 --> 00:39:44.844
And the 4. exercise is: 

527
00:39:44.894 --> 00:39:51.809
Breathing in, I release all the tension in my body.

528
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:59.120
The body has the power to heal itself 

529
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.610
only if we allow it to do that.

530
00:40:05.449 --> 00:40:11.144
When an animal in the forest gets deeply wounded, 

531
00:40:11.195 --> 00:40:14.170
she knows what to do. 

532
00:40:14.219 --> 00:40:18.900
The animal finds a quiet place and lies down. 

533
00:40:19.159 --> 00:40:25.980
She knows deeply that resting is the only way to heal. 

534
00:40:26.029 --> 00:40:34.269
The animal does not think of looking for food, 

535
00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:37.434
or running after an animal. 

536
00:40:37.485 --> 00:40:43.190
She knows that the best thing is to just lie down, 

537
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.050
because the body has the natural tendency, 

538
00:40:48.099 --> 00:40:52.434
natural power to heal itself.

539
00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:59.605
We human beings, we used to have that kind of wisdom, 

540
00:40:59.655 --> 00:41:03.090
but we have lost our capacity to rest. 

541
00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:05.825
We have worked our body too hard. 

542
00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:09.894
We have accumulated a lot of tension in our body, 

543
00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:13.335
and make it more difficult for our body to heal. 

544
00:41:13.385 --> 00:41:23.429
We only count on medicines and other kinds of means. 

545
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:32.295
So the 4. exercise of mindful breathing is every helpful. 

546
00:41:32.344 --> 00:41:37.449
It helps us to be aware of our body. 

547
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:45.095
And our mind becomes embodied again, 

548
00:41:45.144 --> 00:41:49.010
and helps the body to release the tension. 

549
00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:52.920
And when the tension is released, 

550
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:59.269
the body recovers that capacity to heal itself. 

551
00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:05.345
So the practise of mindful sitting with relaxation, 

552
00:42:05.394 --> 00:42:08.070
the practise of mindful walking, 

553
00:42:08.119 --> 00:42:15.275
the practise of mindful breathing while lying down, 

554
00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:19.630
can be very helpful, it can heal.

555
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:30.429
And we do not have to set aside time in order to do that. 

556
00:42:31.429 --> 00:42:33.894
Just, as I said, 

557
00:42:33.945 --> 00:42:36.905
walking from the parking lot to the office 

558
00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.244
you have a time to practise: 

559
00:42:38.295 --> 00:42:41.894
releasing the tension, and enjoying every step, 

560
00:42:41.945 --> 00:42:42.674
and every breath, 

561
00:42:42.724 --> 00:42:45.620
and touching the kingdom of god 

562
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:49.050
around you and inside of you. 

563
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:54.284
The only thing is that there should be 

564
00:42:54.335 --> 00:42:57.090
someone to remind you to do it. 

565
00:42:57.219 --> 00:43:01.739
You may understand it perfectly but you don't do it.

566
00:43:02.909 --> 00:43:06.460
We live as a community. 

567
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:13.204
Our root practise centre is in France, 

568
00:43:13.255 --> 00:43:18.505
but in North America we have Deer Park 

569
00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:22.425
Monastery in southern California, Escondido. 

570
00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:26.905
And we have the Blue Cliff 

571
00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:30.750
practise centre in the state of New York. 

572
00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:36.735
And we live as a four-fold Sangha: 

573
00:43:36.785 --> 00:43:39.589
monks, nuns, and lay-practitioners. 

574
00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:47.150
And we practise together and we remind each other to practise. 

575
00:43:47.199 --> 00:43:49.434
When we listen to the bell, 

576
00:43:49.485 --> 00:43:52.184
hundreds of us listen to the bell together. 

577
00:43:52.235 --> 00:43:55.035
When we sit together, and talk together, 

578
00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:56.985
we do that together. 

579
00:43:57.034 --> 00:44:01.019
And breathing together, walking together, 

580
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.505
sitting together, 

581
00:44:02.554 --> 00:44:06.684
we generate a very powerful collective 

582
00:44:06.735 --> 00:44:14.050
energy of mindfulness, concentration, and compassion. 

583
00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:20.965
And that helps heal us.

584
00:44:21.014 --> 00:44:24.835
When you find yourself in an environment 

585
00:44:24.884 --> 00:44:27.900
filled with that kind of energy: 

586
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:31.644
peace, mindfulness, compassion, 

587
00:44:31.694 --> 00:44:35.659
you get the healing very easily and quickly. 

588
00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:41.724
I think a corporation can organise 

589
00:44:41.775 --> 00:44:46.369
also as a practise community. 

590
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.039
There are times when you can sit together, 

591
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.139
breath together, walk together, 

592
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.675
release the tension together. 

593
00:44:55.724 --> 00:44:59.909
And together we can generate that kind 

594
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:05.110
of collective energy, that is very nourishing and healing. 

595
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:11.230
Our retreats of mindfulness are always attended by 

596
00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:15.190
teenagers and children. 

597
00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:19.240
And there are practitioners who bring their babies. 

598
00:45:19.289 --> 00:45:23.119
Although the babies do not understand the Dharma talk, 

599
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.849
but if they find themselves in an environment, 

600
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.420
that is so peaceful, so compassionate, 

601
00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:36.059
they get the nourishment, they feel it. 

602
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:45.050
So everyone can profit from the practise.

603
00:45:46.639 --> 00:45:49.114
In a practise centre, 

604
00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:52.030
when you need to move from one place to another place, 

605
00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:57.750
you always apply the techniques of mindful walking, 

606
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:04.650
no matter how short or how long the distance is. 

607
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.465
The practise is to arrive in the here and 

608
00:46:09.514 --> 00:46:11.769
now with every step. 

609
00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.420
And touching the wonders of life with every step. 

610
00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:21.909
And while we walk, we do not talk, and we do not think. 

611
00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:29.224
When we stop our thinking, our talking, 

612
00:46:29.275 --> 00:46:33.869
we touch life more deeply, 

613
00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.500
so that we can get the nourishment and the healing. 

614
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.619
And when... 

615
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.389
Let us enjoy breathing together.

616
00:46:55.639 --> 00:47:31.349
[Gong]

617
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.530
When you eat your breakfast, 

618
00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:40.449
you have a chance to practise mindfulness of eating. 

619
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:46.699
You don't have to think about your projects, your work. 

620
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.989
Every moment of breakfast 

621
00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:56.710
is an opportunity for us to get in touch 

622
00:47:56.759 --> 00:47:59.250
with the wonders of life. 

623
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.980
Today we will have a chance to share 

624
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:12.130
a meal together in mindfulness. 

625
00:48:12.769 --> 00:48:15.920
Holding a piece of bread, 

626
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.224
you may like to stop your thinking, 

627
00:48:19.275 --> 00:48:22.239
and look deeply into the piece of bread. 

628
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.590
Mindfully you breath in, 

629
00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:32.474
and you may get in touch with the fact, 

630
00:48:32.525 --> 00:48:36.300
that the piece of bread, that you are holding, 

631
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:39.400
contains the whole universe! 

632
00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:44.739
There is the sunshine, that helped the wheat to grow, 

633
00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:46.400
there is the cloud, 

634
00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:50.324
that provided rain for the wheat to grow, 

635
00:48:50.375 --> 00:48:54.255
the earth is in there, time, space, 

636
00:48:54.305 --> 00:48:57.894
and everything of the cosmos has come together, 

637
00:48:57.944 --> 00:49:01.345
in order to help produce that piece of bread. 

638
00:49:01.394 --> 00:49:04.295
And that insight you can get in just a few 

639
00:49:04.345 --> 00:49:08.380
seconds of looking mindfully at that piece of bread. 

640
00:49:08.429 --> 00:49:12.045
If you keep thinking about the past, 

641
00:49:12.095 --> 00:49:15.394
or the future, or your projects, you miss the bread. 

642
00:49:15.444 --> 00:49:18.235
You miss the kingdom of god, 

643
00:49:18.284 --> 00:49:22.690
that the bread is bringing to you. 

644
00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:28.539
And when you put the piece of breath in your mouth, 

645
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.375
you may like to enjoy just chewing the bread. 

646
00:49:31.425 --> 00:49:34.820
Getting in touch with the wonders of life. 

647
00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:37.784
Instead of chewing your projects, 

648
00:49:37.835 --> 00:49:44.039
your worries, your fear, you stop all your thinking. 

649
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:47.494
You just enjoy eating your breakfast. 

650
00:49:47.545 --> 00:49:49.650
And that is a practise. 

651
00:49:49.699 --> 00:49:55.360
You don't need to set aside time for practising.

652
00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.485
When you take a shower, 

653
00:49:59.534 --> 00:50:02.625
that is time to practise mindfulness. 

654
00:50:02.674 --> 00:50:07.215
You may enjoy your mindful breathing, 

655
00:50:07.264 --> 00:50:12.469
and become aware of the water, of your body, 

656
00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:17.230
and you can create the joy 

657
00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:21.534
and happiness while taking a shower. 

658
00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:25.079
The essential is to stop thinking. 

659
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:29.865
The thinking will carry you away, 

660
00:50:29.914 --> 00:50:35.929
and does not allow you live that moment of life. 

661
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.045
René Descartes said that: 

662
00:50:40.094 --> 00:50:41.894
I think, therefore I am.

663
00:50:41.945 --> 00:50:44.345
I am not very sure of that. 

664
00:50:44.394 --> 00:50:50.320
Because if you think so much, you go around your thinking. 

665
00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:53.664
Your thinking may not be productive at all. 

666
00:50:53.714 --> 00:50:56.215
It carries you to many realms, 

667
00:50:56.264 --> 00:51:02.639
and makes you worry more, angrier, and so on. 

668
00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:06.974
So if you are carried away by your thinking, 

669
00:51:07.025 --> 00:51:08.594
you are not there. 

670
00:51:08.644 --> 00:51:10.134
That is why: 

671
00:51:10.184 --> 00:51:13.420
I think, therefore I am not there.

672
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.980
It is better to stop the thinking in order to be there.

673
00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:25.035
When we brush our teeth, 

674
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:29.800
we may choose to brush our teeth in such a way, 

675
00:51:29.849 --> 00:51:33.259
that makes freedom, and joy, 

676
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:36.045
and happiness possible during the time 

677
00:51:36.095 --> 00:51:37.525
of brushing our teeth. 

678
00:51:37.574 --> 00:51:43.844
I may take 2 minutes, or 3 minutes, 

679
00:51:43.894 --> 00:51:48.579
and the essential is to stop your thinking, 

680
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:52.309
even if you have a lot of things to do - 

681
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:59.199
stop your thinking, and enjoy brushing your teeth. 

682
00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:03.420
When I brush my teeth I 

683
00:52:03.469 --> 00:52:08.304
usually touch the fact that I am over 80, 

684
00:52:08.355 --> 00:52:11.320
and still have some teeth to brush, 

685
00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:15.179
and that is enough to make me happy. 

686
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.735
Brush your teeth in such a way, 

687
00:52:18.784 --> 00:52:23.019
that freedom is possible, 

688
00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:27.284
joy and happiness be possible during the time 

689
00:52:27.335 --> 00:52:28.880
of tooth-brush. 

690
00:52:28.929 --> 00:52:31.255
That is a challenge. 

691
00:52:31.304 --> 00:52:35.570
And I know you can do it. 

692
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:40.059
Do not think about your work, your projects. 

693
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:44.885
Just enjoy being there and brush your teeth. 

694
00:52:44.934 --> 00:52:49.869
That moment, you can live it deeply also, 

695
00:52:51.429 --> 00:52:56.840
because you can always touch the wonders of life, 

696
00:52:57.539 --> 00:53:02.119
the kingdom of god, in the here and the now.

697
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:15.889
We used to distinguish between time for work and free time. 

698
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:23.989
Let us change our way of thinking. 

699
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:32.260
Suppose you have some free time. 

700
00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:38.914
And if you do not know how to make use of your free time, 

701
00:53:38.965 --> 00:53:41.369
your time is not truly free. 

702
00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.094
If you keep thinking, and worrying, 

703
00:53:46.144 --> 00:53:51.320
that time does not make you happy. 

704
00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.375
That time is not for working of course, 

705
00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:02.789
but you continue to think about it, 

706
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.400
you continue to worry about, 

707
00:54:06.639 --> 00:54:11.340
and that thinking is not productive. 

708
00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:25.940
It is very important to learn how to release, 

709
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:30.570
and to be fully in the moment.

710
00:54:35.019 --> 00:54:43.510
And watering the vegetable garden, 

711
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:55.210
in the backyard, you may like to be fully present with that. 

712
00:54:57.269 --> 00:55:00.280
Cooking breakfast, 

713
00:55:00.329 --> 00:55:01.384
you may like to 

714
00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:06.179
make breakfast cooking into a session of meditation. 

715
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:10.605
You can enjoy every minute of breakfast making. 

716
00:55:10.654 --> 00:55:15.414
You don't try to do it quickly in order to have breakfast. 

717
00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:17.945
Or doing the dishes. 

718
00:55:17.994 --> 00:55:21.795
You can enjoy deeply every second of doing dishes. 

719
00:55:21.845 --> 00:55:24.170
And don't have to try to finish 

720
00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.414
quickly in order to do other things. 

721
00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:30.155
We have the tendency to rush, 

722
00:55:30.204 --> 00:55:34.590
to finish quickly with with what we are doing. 

723
00:55:34.639 --> 00:55:37.445
It has become a habit. 

724
00:55:37.494 --> 00:55:40.974
And with mindfulness of breathing, 

725
00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:43.090
you can recognise that habit, 

726
00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:46.005
and then help you to stop being carried 

727
00:55:46.055 --> 00:55:51.619
away by that kind of attitude.

728
00:55:54.079 --> 00:55:57.650
Suppose you are washing dishes, 

729
00:55:57.699 --> 00:56:00.735
and you want to finish in order to sit down, 

730
00:56:00.785 --> 00:56:03.730
and enjoy a cup of tea. 

731
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.380
With the practise of mindfulness, 

732
00:56:09.429 --> 00:56:12.775
you can make the time of dish-washing 

733
00:56:12.824 --> 00:56:16.950
a beautiful time also, a joyful time, 

734
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.349
when being fully alive. 

735
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.860
And if you are not capable of doing so, 

736
00:56:23.909 --> 00:56:26.715
when you finish washing dishes, and sit down, 

737
00:56:26.764 --> 00:56:28.284
and hold the cup of tea, 

738
00:56:28.335 --> 00:56:29.485
you will think of other things - 

739
00:56:29.535 --> 00:56:31.849
you will not be able to enjoy your tea. 

740
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.965
You are always carried away. 

741
00:56:35.014 --> 00:56:37.840
You are not capable of living your live 

742
00:56:37.889 --> 00:56:39.659
in the present moment. 

743
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:42.889
And mindfulness helps us to live deeply 

744
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.394
every moment of our daily life. 

745
00:56:45.444 --> 00:56:48.569
And we need some training in order to do so. 

746
00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:53.054
If we have a chance to live with a community of practise, 

747
00:56:53.105 --> 00:56:58.174
and then we get that habit of living deeply each moment 

748
00:56:58.224 --> 00:57:00.070
of our daily life.

749
00:57:04.969 --> 00:57:09.059
In Buddhist meditation, 

750
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:19.739
we know that insight is the factor, 

751
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:27.380
that can help us transform afflictions like anger, 

752
00:57:27.429 --> 00:57:29.869
fear, despair. 

753
00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:35.380
Insight is the kind of energy that can liberate us. 

754
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:43.739
And we know that insight is not the outcome of thinking. 

755
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.235
We have the thinking mind, 

756
00:57:47.284 --> 00:57:52.380
but our consciousness is more then the thinking mind. 

757
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.360
In Buddhism we speak of store consciousness. 

758
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:11.490
And that is something much bigger than our thinking mind. 

759
00:58:11.539 --> 00:58:15.929
Imagine an iceberg in the ocean. 

760
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:20.144
The part that we see above the water is very small. 

761
00:58:20.194 --> 00:58:25.070
But the part in the water is huge. 

762
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:28.099
Store consciousness is like that. 

763
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.125
Our mind consciousness is very small.


764
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:35.630
In neuroscience people like to speak of 

765
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:39.599
that part of consciousness as background consciousness.

766
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:49.619
Sometimes we call it root consciousness, mūla-vijñāna.

767
00:58:52.199 --> 00:58:57.230
Sometimes we call it appropriating consciousness.

768
00:58:57.279 --> 00:59:00.940
Sometimes we call it store consciousness.

769
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:05.155
That part of consciousness is always with the body. 

770
00:59:05.204 --> 00:59:13.750
It has the capacity to retrieve information. 

771
00:59:14.119 --> 00:59:18.250
It has the capacity to process information. 

772
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:25.230
And it has the capacity to preserve, 

773
00:59:25.279 --> 00:59:30.039
to conserve information. 

774
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:41.949
And mind consciousness is the upper level of consciousness. 

775
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:48.114
Mind consciousness sometimes can stop operating, 

776
00:59:48.164 --> 00:59:50.539
like in the case: 

777
00:59:53.719 --> 00:59:56.235
you sleep without dream. 

778
00:59:56.284 --> 00:59:59.905
Your mind consciousness stops completely, 

779
00:59:59.954 --> 01:00:03.735
if you do not have dream in your sleep. 

780
01:00:03.784 --> 01:00:07.875
There is a kind of meditation concentration 

781
01:00:07.925 --> 01:00:13.865
called Nopess[?] perception meditation. 

782
01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:16.289
And when the practitioner goes into that 

783
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:21.539
meditation his mind consciousness stops operating also. 

784
01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:26.144
And we talk about realm of life 

785
01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:28.664
where there is no mind consciousness, 

786
01:00:28.715 --> 01:00:31.349
there is only store consciousness.

787
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:35.025
Suppose we look at a tree. 

788
01:00:35.074 --> 01:00:40.445
We know that somehow there is consciousness in the tree, 

789
01:00:40.494 --> 01:00:44.625
because the tree knows how to gather information, 

790
01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:48.625
to process information, to get the nourishment, 

791
01:00:48.675 --> 01:00:52.655
to react, to survive. 

792
01:00:52.704 --> 01:00:54.695
Consciousness is in a tree. 

793
01:00:54.744 --> 01:00:58.980
But the tree does not seem to have, 

794
01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:03.445
doing a lot of thinking. 

795
01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:06.664
There is a Vietnamese poet who says that: 

796
01:01:06.715 --> 01:01:09.445
Well, next life, I would like to be a pine tree. 

797
01:01:09.494 --> 01:01:12.375
So that I don't have to think. 

798
01:01:12.425 --> 01:01:16.179
To think makes me suffer too much.

799
01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:28.059
In the Zen tradition mind consciousness is the gardener, 

800
01:01:28.239 --> 01:01:35.750
and store consciousness is the land, it is the garden. 

801
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:42.085
The gardener can prepare the land, 

802
01:01:42.134 --> 01:01:47.980
plant the seed, water the seed. 

803
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:52.230
But it is store consciousness, it is the land, 

804
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:59.219
that can produce the flower and the fruit of enlightenment. 

805
01:01:59.659 --> 01:02:03.800
So practising meditation we don't count 

806
01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:06.375
on mind consciousness alone, 

807
01:02:06.424 --> 01:02:10.679
we count mostly on store consciousness. 

808
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:22.105
Mind consciousness has to play the role of the gardener. 

809
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:28.510
It has to work the land, and plant the seed well, 

810
01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:31.865
and cover up, and water. 

811
01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.599
That is all. 

812
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:39.215
The insight, the discovery, what we find out, 

813
01:02:39.264 --> 01:02:41.570
is not the work of mind consciousness, 

814
01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:46.349
it is the work of store. 

815
01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:53.155
And many scientific discoveries have been done in that: 

816
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:57.954
not by the thinking, the thinking mind, 

817
01:02:58.005 --> 01:03:03.500
but by the unconscious, unconscious mind.

818
01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:08.769
So it is possible for us 

819
01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:17.349
to entrust the task to our deeper consciousness. 

820
01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:24.115
We have to pose the question to ask the question correctly. 

821
01:03:24.164 --> 01:03:29.139
In Zen Buddhism we call that Koan. 

822
01:03:32.739 --> 01:03:37.389
Suppose the teacher gives you the Koan: 

823
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.949
Everything comes home to the one. 

824
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.085
Where the one will go, have to go?

825
01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:53.650
Or: 

826
01:03:55.739 --> 01:04:01.309
What is the sound of one hand?

827
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.039
All these are devices. 

828
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:13.269
This kind of question that we entrust to 

829
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.300
store consciousness. 

830
01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:19.769
The important thing is to 

831
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.710
ask the right question very clearly, 

832
01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:32.539
and to entrust the question to store consciousness. 

833
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.309
And after having done that, 

834
01:04:36.359 --> 01:04:44.389
the gardener may like to do other things.

835
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.480
There is a Buddhist scholar in America. 

836
01:04:55.559 --> 01:05:02.769
One time I told him that I enjoy gardening. 

837
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:11.295
I enjoy planting lettuce and things like that. 

838
01:05:11.344 --> 01:05:16.384
And I say that, when the lettuce does not grow well, 

839
01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:20.769
you don't blame the lettuce, 

840
01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:27.284
but you feel that if the lettuce grow well or not well, 

841
01:05:27.335 --> 01:05:30.174
it is the gardener who is responsible. 

842
01:05:30.224 --> 01:05:31.335
And he said: 

843
01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:34.980
Thay, you should not spend your time growing lettuce, 

844
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:40.000
because you can use your time to write poems.

845
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.780
Because he liked my poetry. 

846
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.764
I told him: 

847
01:05:45.815 --> 01:05:48.994
Dear friend, if I do not grow lettuce, 

848
01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.575
I can not write these poems. 

849
01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:56.755
It is because I am capable of growing lettuce, 

850
01:05:56.804 --> 01:06:00.429
that is why I can produce a poem like that.

851
01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:10.789
So washing your dishes, enjoying washing the dishes, 

852
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.304
stop the thinking, 

853
01:06:12.355 --> 01:06:15.289
and get the pleasure in washing the dishes, 

854
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.559
is a way to support store consciousness 

855
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.800
to bring about insight. 

856
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.845
Brushing your teeth mindfully, 

857
01:06:27.894 --> 01:06:30.150
and enjoy brushing your teeth, 

858
01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:35.380
do not think about your project, 

859
01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:40.514
do not try to find the solution with your thinking mind. 

860
01:06:40.565 --> 01:06:43.519
And that is the practise. 

861
01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:51.295
Non-thinking is the secret of the success. 

862
01:06:51.344 --> 01:06:57.074
And that is why the time, when we are not working, 

863
01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:59.710
that time can be very productive, 

864
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.910
if we know how to focus on the moment, 

865
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.914
and enjoy every moment of our daily live. 

866
01:07:07.964 --> 01:07:10.269
And if we know how to do that, 

867
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.615
we will not be victims of stress, anxiety, 

868
01:07:13.664 --> 01:07:17.444
depression, and so on. 

869
01:07:17.494 --> 01:07:20.920
That is one aspect of the problem. 

870
01:07:20.969 --> 01:07:23.384
The other aspect of the problem is, 

871
01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:27.694
that the time called work time, 

872
01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.724
we can handle it in such a way, 

873
01:07:29.775 --> 01:07:33.769
that we can enjoy, that it can bring us pleasure. 

874
01:07:37.739 --> 01:07:42.925
There is a way not to be under pressure. 

875
01:07:42.974 --> 01:07:45.994
There is a way in order to enjoy really 

876
01:07:46.045 --> 01:07:49.079
what you are doing as work.

877
01:07:53.559 --> 01:07:58.425
We in Plum Village, we do a lot of things. 

878
01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:05.085
We want to succeed in what we do. 

879
01:08:05.135 --> 01:08:09.039
We offer many retreats of mindfulness everywhere, 

880
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:14.985
in many countries, Europe, Asia, America, Australia. 

881
01:08:15.034 --> 01:08:18.530
We organise days of mindfulness, 

882
01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:20.364
sessions of practise, 

883
01:08:20.414 --> 01:08:25.255
we organise retreats for health professionals, 

884
01:08:25.304 --> 01:08:29.670
school teachers, young people, and so on. 

885
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.949
We want to succeed in our work also. 

886
01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:40.385
But we learned how to do the work in such a way, 

887
01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:48.090
that we will not be victims of pressure and stress. 

888
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:59.954
Many monks and nuns, who are excellent Dharma teachers, 

889
01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:04.680
they enjoy cooking, they enjoy cleaning, 

890
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:07.095
they enjoy gardening, 

891
01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:09.760
and they consider these things as 

892
01:09:09.809 --> 01:09:14.300
important as the other kind of work. 

893
01:09:14.539 --> 01:09:18.310
We learned how to enjoy rearranging the 

894
01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:21.279
cushions in the meditation hall. 

895
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.365
We enjoy growing vegetables, and everything we do, 

896
01:09:31.414 --> 01:09:33.694
we put all our heart and mind in it, 

897
01:09:33.744 --> 01:09:38.575
and we try to do it in such a way, 

898
01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:42.795
that freedom and joy and brotherhood and 

899
01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:45.340
sisterhood become possible.

900
01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:52.595
There are times when we sit together in a meeting, 

901
01:09:52.644 --> 01:09:58.024
but we don't talk about work. 

902
01:09:58.074 --> 01:10:02.739
We have a weekly meeting called meeting of happiness. 

903
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:10.034
And in the meeting you just remind each other, 

904
01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:14.180
that we have so many conditions of happiness available. 

905
01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:17.815
It may take 2 hours, 3 hours, 

906
01:10:17.864 --> 01:10:20.074
just with one cup of tea, 

907
01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:26.310
and we nourish each other with the practise of mindfulness. 

908
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.255
We remind each other, that we are very lucky people - 

909
01:10:32.305 --> 01:10:35.225
that we have so many conditions of happiness 

910
01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:37.595
available right in the here and the now, 

911
01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:41.865
we don't need to go and look for more 

912
01:10:41.914 --> 01:10:44.020
conditions of happiness. 

913
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.899
And that is every nourishing. 

914
01:10:46.949 --> 01:10:52.739
And I think that in a corporation, this is possible also. 

915
01:10:54.210 --> 01:11:03.505
And many of the practise in the practise centre can be used 

916
01:11:03.554 --> 01:11:07.920
in the life of a corporation.

917
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.895
Every time we organise a retreat, 6 days or 7 

918
01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:31.189
days, we see many people transform. 

919
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:38.574
The practise is simple enough for everyone to do. 

920
01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:41.485
The practise of mindful breathing, 

921
01:11:41.534 --> 01:11:43.614
mindful sitting and walking, 

922
01:11:43.664 --> 01:11:51.210
releasing the tension in the body, everyone can do. 

923
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:56.880
And when you are able to reduce the tension in your body, 

924
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.725
to release the tension in your body, 

925
01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:03.529
you also can reduce the amount of pain in your body, 

926
01:12:03.579 --> 01:12:06.109
including necrotic pain. 

927
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:09.494
Because the pain and tension they go together. 

928
01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:14.725
If you can release tension, you can reduce the pain. 

929
01:12:14.774 --> 01:12:17.905
And the basic practise of mindful breathing, 

930
01:12:17.954 --> 01:12:20.795
to be aware of your body, 

931
01:12:20.844 --> 01:12:23.145
and to release the tension in your body, 

932
01:12:23.194 --> 01:12:28.380
you can do it several times a day. 

933
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:32.125
Many of our brothers and sisters have programmed a 

934
01:12:32.174 --> 01:12:34.829
bell of mindfulness in the computer. 

935
01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:41.260
And every 15 minutes, the bell reminds us to stop, and to 

936
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:45.939
enjoy breathing in and breathing out - 

937
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.029
the bell of mindfulness.

938
01:12:52.140 --> 01:13:19.310
[Gong]

939
01:13:19.359 --> 01:13:25.829
The practise helps us to touch 

940
01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:30.395
the conditions of happiness in the here and now, 

941
01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:34.684
so that we can generate a feeling of joy 

942
01:13:34.734 --> 01:13:37.439
at any moment we want. 

943
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:41.550
And that is not too difficult. 

944
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.880
If you go back to your body, 

945
01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.619
if you bring your mind home to your body, 

946
01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:53.284
and establish yourself in the here and the now, 

947
01:13:53.335 --> 01:13:57.230
your will realise that conditions for 

948
01:13:57.279 --> 01:13:59.635
your happiness are more then enough, 

949
01:13:59.684 --> 01:14:03.404
and happiness is possible right in the here and the now. 

950
01:14:03.454 --> 01:14:08.199
So to generate a moment of joy is possible, 

951
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:11.195
to generate a moment of happiness is also 

952
01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:17.569
possible for a practitioner, no matter where and when.

953
01:14:17.909 --> 01:14:24.215
And the practise of mindfulness also helps us to recognise a painful feeling, 

954
01:14:24.264 --> 01:14:28.600
a painful emotion, when they manifest. 

955
01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:38.045
A painful feeling, we try, 

956
01:14:38.095 --> 01:14:42.300
we have the tendency to try to run away from it. 

957
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:46.409
We want to cover it up by consumption. 

958
01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:53.195
If we listen to music, if we read magazines, 

959
01:14:53.244 --> 01:14:56.060
if we eat, 

960
01:14:57.069 --> 01:15:04.125
maybe it is not because these things bring 

961
01:15:04.174 --> 01:15:05.565
us a lot of happiness, 

962
01:15:05.614 --> 01:15:08.560
but because we don't want to get in touch 

963
01:15:08.609 --> 01:15:09.635
with the suffering. 

964
01:15:09.685 --> 01:15:15.275
We want to cover it up with consumption. 

965
01:15:15.324 --> 01:15:19.234
Obesity is the outcome of that. 

966
01:15:19.284 --> 01:15:24.369
You have the feeling of loneliness, 

967
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.760
despair, anger, worries in you, 

968
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:32.774
and you do not know how to handle, 

969
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:36.475
and that is why you want to forget, to run away. 

970
01:15:36.524 --> 01:15:40.564
And one of the ways is to just consume. 

971
01:15:40.614 --> 01:15:44.720
So music, magazines, food, 

972
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:48.500
are there in order to help you to cover up your suffering. 

973
01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:51.159
You do not solve the problem.

974
01:15:51.819 --> 01:15:55.755
But the practise consists in going home, 

975
01:15:55.804 --> 01:15:58.640
and take good care of that pain: 

976
01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:04.435
Breathing in, I am aware of the painful feeling in me.

977
01:16:04.484 --> 01:16:07.660
There is the energy of pain of course. 

978
01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:10.525
But as a practitioner you generate the 

979
01:16:10.574 --> 01:16:13.029
energy of mindfulness and concentration, 

980
01:16:13.079 --> 01:16:17.609
and with the second energy you recognise the first energy. 

981
01:16:17.659 --> 01:16:20.310
Hello there my little pain. 

982
01:16:20.359 --> 01:16:23.070
I know you are there. 

983
01:16:23.119 --> 01:16:25.185
I will take good care of you.

984
01:16:25.234 --> 01:16:31.190
So like a mother, holding her baby, 

985
01:16:31.239 --> 01:16:33.265
when the body suffers, 

986
01:16:33.314 --> 01:16:37.730
the practitioner generates the energy of mindfulness and concentration, 

987
01:16:37.779 --> 01:16:41.364
and go home, and take care of the painful feeling, 

988
01:16:41.414 --> 01:16:47.239
or the painful emotion in him or in her, and get a relief.

989
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:51.954
So many young people are not capable of 

990
01:16:52.004 --> 01:16:54.430
handling a strong emotion. 

991
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.110
And they believe that the only way 

992
01:16:59.159 --> 01:17:02.904
to stop suffering is go and kill themselves. 

993
01:17:02.954 --> 01:17:07.055
That is why so many young people commit suicide everywhere. 

994
01:17:07.104 --> 01:17:10.659
But we know very well that an emotion, 

995
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:16.995
whether it is strong, however strong it is, 

996
01:17:17.045 --> 01:17:18.680
it is only an emotion. 

997
01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:22.529
And we are much more that an emotion. 

998
01:17:22.579 --> 01:17:24.475
We don't have to. 

999
01:17:24.524 --> 01:17:27.960
An emotion that is something, that comes, 

1000
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:31.715
and stays for some time, and finally will have to go away. 

1001
01:17:31.764 --> 01:17:36.355
Why do we have to die, because of just one emotion? 

1002
01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:39.899
That is what you can remind yourself, 

1003
01:17:39.949 --> 01:17:44.300
when an emotion manifests in you. 

1004
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:51.050
And if you know the practise of mindful breathing, 

1005
01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:55.289
mindful walking, generating the energy of mindfulness, 

1006
01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:01.100
you can every well recognise and embrace that emotion, 

1007
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:03.480
and you are save. 

1008
01:18:03.529 --> 01:18:07.659
An emotion is like a storm coming. 

1009
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:11.220
And there are ways in order to stand, 

1010
01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:16.340
and not to allow the storm to blow you away.

1011
01:18:16.389 --> 01:18:19.710
The practise of deep breathing, 

1012
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.244
in a position of sitting or laying down: 

1013
01:18:24.295 --> 01:18:29.920
focus your attention on the rise and fall of your abdomen. 

1014
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:33.465
And just that, stop all the thinking. 

1015
01:18:33.514 --> 01:18:35.020
Because the more you think, 

1016
01:18:35.069 --> 01:18:38.880
the stronger the emotion can become. 

1017
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:41.950
Stopping the thinking. 

1018
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.380
Bring your mind down to the level of the navel, 

1019
01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:52.159
and breath in deeply, 

1020
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:56.755
and become aware of the rise and fall of your abdomen, 

1021
01:18:56.805 --> 01:19:00.055
and stay in that position, and continue, 

1022
01:19:00.104 --> 01:19:05.739
and your emotion could not do anything to you. 

1023
01:19:05.789 --> 01:19:10.015
And after 5 minutes, 10 minutes or even half an hour, 

1024
01:19:10.064 --> 01:19:13.744
the emotion will go, and you will survive it. 

1025
01:19:13.795 --> 01:19:19.720
And next time, when it comes, you will do just that. 

1026
01:19:19.769 --> 01:19:22.244
It is easy enough. 

1027
01:19:22.295 --> 01:19:27.795
We should train ourselves only a few times every day. 

1028
01:19:27.844 --> 01:19:31.914
If we know how to do it for a few minutes, 

1029
01:19:31.965 --> 01:19:37.149
and then after a few weeks it will become a habit. 

1030
01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:40.375
And when the emotion manifests you will 

1031
01:19:40.424 --> 01:19:42.484
remember to practise. 

1032
01:19:42.534 --> 01:19:46.369
And you are no longer afraid of an emotion.

1033
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:52.845
So when the baby suffers, the mother should be there, 

1034
01:19:52.894 --> 01:19:57.369
in order to pick up the baby, and hold the baby tenderly. 

1035
01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:01.615
The mother does not know what is the cause of the 

1036
01:20:01.664 --> 01:20:02.949
suffering of the baby, 

1037
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.175
but the fact that she is holding the baby tenderly, 

1038
01:20:06.224 --> 01:20:09.795
can already make the baby suffer less. 

1039
01:20:09.845 --> 01:20:12.785
Because the energy of tenderness begins 

1040
01:20:12.835 --> 01:20:18.295
to penetrate into the baby, that brings a relief. 

1041
01:20:18.345 --> 01:20:23.609
And after having held the child for a few minutes, 

1042
01:20:23.659 --> 01:20:27.570
the mother may find out what is wrong with the baby, 

1043
01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:31.079
and she can change the situation easily. 

1044
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.725
The same is true with a practitioner. 

1045
01:20:33.774 --> 01:20:34.704
In the beginning, 

1046
01:20:34.754 --> 01:20:39.835
she does not know what is the root of that pain, 

1047
01:20:39.884 --> 01:20:41.789
that emotion. 

1048
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.789
But the fact that she is able to hold it tenderly, 

1049
01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:58.555
without an attempt to run away, can already bring a relief. 

1050
01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:04.095
And with a little more of concentration and mindfulness, 

1051
01:21:04.144 --> 01:21:06.090
we can discover the nature, 

1052
01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:08.430
the roots of our emotion, 

1053
01:21:08.479 --> 01:21:17.295
and that will help transform the emotion and the pain.

1054
01:21:17.345 --> 01:21:22.045
And if adult, father, mother, 

1055
01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:24.425
school teachers know how to do that, 

1056
01:21:24.474 --> 01:21:28.449
they will teach the young people how to do it. 

1057
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:32.315
It is easy enough to learn. 

1058
01:21:32.364 --> 01:21:38.260
And therefore, a practitioner of mindfulness is capable of:


1059
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.965
releasing the tension in her body,

1060
01:21:41.014 --> 01:21:44.295
reduce the pain in his body,

1061
01:21:44.344 --> 01:21:49.494
generate a feeling of joy whenever he wants,

1062
01:21:49.545 --> 01:21:53.904
generate a feeling of happiness whenever she wants,

1063
01:21:53.954 --> 01:21:58.235
recognise and embrace a painful feeling,

1064
01:21:58.284 --> 01:22:02.970
recognise and embrace a painful emotion.

1065
01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:07.300
All these things can be learned.  

1066
01:22:07.349 --> 01:22:10.220
And we hope that in the future, 

1067
01:22:10.449 --> 01:22:13.585
these kinds of practises can be taught in 

1068
01:22:13.634 --> 01:22:15.590
school at every level. 

1069
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.360
We are trying to do that. 

1070
01:22:18.409 --> 01:22:23.619
We have met with school teachers in many counties, 

1071
01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:29.715
and they all agree, that this is something they must learn, 

1072
01:22:29.764 --> 01:22:34.649
and bring into the classroom, and help the young people.

1073
01:22:51.569 --> 01:23:15.300
[Gong]

1074
01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.814
The miracle of transformation and healing 

1075
01:23:20.864 --> 01:23:25.630
always happen in our retreats. 

1076
01:23:29.359 --> 01:23:33.835
During this North American tour, 

1077
01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:38.795
we have offered a retreat in Vancouver for 800 people, 

1078
01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:46.055
after that another retreat for more than 900 in Colorado, 

1079
01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:49.699
and we just finished one in Southern California, 

1080
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:55.239
Escondido for 700 people. 

1081
01:23:55.289 --> 01:24:00.414
And the miracle of transformation and healing 

1082
01:24:00.465 --> 01:24:01.980
always happened. 

1083
01:24:02.029 --> 01:24:08.204
And using the practise of compassionate listening 

1084
01:24:08.255 --> 01:24:12.774
and gentle speech, many people are able, 

1085
01:24:12.824 --> 01:24:22.260
are capable of restoring communication and reconcile. 

1086
01:24:22.309 --> 01:24:24.729
And there are those of us, 

1087
01:24:24.779 --> 01:24:28.039
who can use our mobile phone 

1088
01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:31.984
to practise listening with compassion, 

1089
01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:34.960
and using loving speech in order to 

1090
01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:37.445
reconcile with those who are at home, 

1091
01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:39.609
who are not in the retreat. 

1092
01:24:40.079 --> 01:24:43.645
And we have been offering so many retreats 

1093
01:24:43.694 --> 01:24:48.579
like that in the world, and seen that the effect, 

1094
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.315
the result, the foot of the practise, 

1095
01:24:53.364 --> 01:24:55.824
we are encouraged in this practise. 

1096
01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:59.950
That is why as monks and nuns and lay practitioners, 

1097
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.385
we are going to continue, 

1098
01:25:02.434 --> 01:25:07.180
because that brings us a lot of happiness.

1099
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:09.805
And we want to share the practise, 

1100
01:25:09.854 --> 01:25:12.420
and to help many people to suffer less. 

1101
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:18.619
And that is why we want also success. 

1102
01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:25.060
But our success, our willingness to succeed, 

1103
01:25:27.439 --> 01:25:34.029
does not remove us from the present moment. 

1104
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.875
Our practise is to, 

1105
01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:42.960
is to be grounded always in the present moment. 

1106
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:51.145
We know that the future is made only of one element: 

1107
01:25:51.194 --> 01:25:53.574
that is the present moment. 

1108
01:25:53.625 --> 01:26:00.190
And if we take of the present moment the best way we can, 

1109
01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:02.735
it means that we have done everything we 

1110
01:26:02.784 --> 01:26:04.989
can do for the future. 

1111
01:26:05.039 --> 01:26:08.430
And that is our practise: 

1112
01:26:08.479 --> 01:26:10.730
to be there in the here and the now, 

1113
01:26:10.779 --> 01:26:12.810
and do our best with that, 

1114
01:26:12.859 --> 01:26:23.770
and do not let the worries, the projects, carry us away.

1115
01:26:25.369 --> 01:26:34.960
I think many are successful in their career, 

1116
01:26:35.869 --> 01:26:41.090
but many have become victims of their own success. 

1117
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.605
They are not happy. 

1118
01:26:44.654 --> 01:27:00.199
Happiness is not the aim. 

1119
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:07.310
When we do something, we want to succeed. 

1120
01:27:08.329 --> 01:27:15.270
But is it worthwhile to continue, 

1121
01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:21.399
if that success does not bring happiness? 

1122
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:32.329
And many have become victims of their own success. 

1123
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:39.024
And although they succeed in their enterprise, 

1124
01:27:39.074 --> 01:27:44.055
but happiness is not there. 

1125
01:27:44.104 --> 01:27:52.220
They have no time to love, to live their life. 

1126
01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.750
They have no time for themselves, 

1127
01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.010
they have no time for their beloved one.

1128
01:27:59.689 --> 01:28:04.850
I know a successful businessman in Germany. 

1129
01:28:04.899 --> 01:28:07.725
His name is Frederick. 

1130
01:28:07.774 --> 01:28:11.930
He is only 40. 

1131
01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:15.444
He is a very successful businessman. 

1132
01:28:15.494 --> 01:28:18.990
But his wife Laura suffers very deeply, 

1133
01:28:19.039 --> 01:28:20.800
because of loneliness, 

1134
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:23.614
because Frederick did not have the time, 

1135
01:28:23.664 --> 01:28:31.329
even for himself, and for her, and for their son. 

1136
01:28:33.289 --> 01:28:41.815
She tried to suffer less by doing human talent work. 

1137
01:28:41.864 --> 01:28:45.130
She tried to forget her loneliness by 

1138
01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:51.235
going to school and get another degree. 

1139
01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:53.239
But that did not help. 

1140
01:28:53.289 --> 01:28:56.755
And she cried during the night. 

1141
01:28:56.805 --> 01:28:58.295
And he said that: 

1142
01:28:58.344 --> 01:29:04.750
Darling, no-one can replace me now. 

1143
01:29:06.729 --> 01:29:10.015
I have to wait 3, 4 years, 

1144
01:29:10.064 --> 01:29:13.085
before I can find someone to replace me, 

1145
01:29:13.135 --> 01:29:15.345
and then we will have more time for 

1146
01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:18.819
ourselves and for our son. 

1147
01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:24.550
For the moment, no-one can replace me.

1148
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:30.074
And that promise was never been fulfilled, 

1149
01:29:30.125 --> 01:29:36.614
because 6 months later he got killed in an accident, 

1150
01:29:36.664 --> 01:29:38.840
car accident. 

1151
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:47.175
He was so busy, that when his wife was hospitalised, 

1152
01:29:47.225 --> 01:29:50.940
he could not have the time to go to the hospital. 

1153
01:29:50.989 --> 01:29:57.079
And even when his son Phillip was hospitalised, 

1154
01:29:57.130 --> 01:30:02.154
he could not go to the hospital, 

1155
01:30:02.204 --> 01:30:04.895
because his time, 

1156
01:30:04.944 --> 01:30:10.479
his energy is sucked by the will to succeed. 

1157
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.340
And you know what happened: 

1158
01:30:13.389 --> 01:30:15.980
only 3 days after his death, 

1159
01:30:16.029 --> 01:30:19.579
they found someone to replace him. 

1160
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:30.159
And Frederick is still alive. 

1161
01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.515
There are many Frederick among us. 

1162
01:30:37.564 --> 01:30:40.954
And many Laura are among us. 

1163
01:30:41.005 --> 01:30:44.170
We have to wake up from that. 

1164
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:48.380
We have to learn how to 

1165
01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:56.670
change our way of life in order to be, to be truly alive. 

1166
01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:05.395
And the practise of mindfulness helps us bring real love, 

1167
01:31:05.444 --> 01:31:10.079
real happiness to our life.

1168
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:15.925
There are 4 elements of true love (Brahmavihāras), 

1169
01:31:15.975 --> 01:31:21.840
that mindfulness can help generate:


1170
01:31:21.889 --> 01:31:28.439
The 1. element of true love is loving kindness, Maitrī. 

1171
01:31:28.489 --> 01:31:34.159
That is the capacity to make another person happy. 

1172
01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:39.350
And we have already learned that, 

1173
01:31:39.399 --> 01:31:42.740
if we cannot make ourselves peaceful, 

1174
01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:47.600
fresh, and happy, we cannot make another person happy. 

1175
01:31:47.649 --> 01:31:52.920
The practise of mindfulness helps restore solidity, 

1176
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:57.119
freedom, piece, and freshness to us, 

1177
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:59.300
so that we can, 

1178
01:31:59.349 --> 01:32:03.800
we have the capacity to make the other person happy.

1179
01:32:03.849 --> 01:32:11.630
The 2. element of true love is compassion, Karuṇā. 

1180
01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.190
That capacity of understanding the suffering 

1181
01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.779
and help remove it. 

1182
01:32:18.829 --> 01:32:20.664
If you love someone, 

1183
01:32:20.715 --> 01:32:24.274
you should understand the suffering in him or in her, 

1184
01:32:24.324 --> 01:32:29.750
and you should be able to help transform that, remove that. 

1185
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:34.690
And that you can do only after you have done it for you. 

1186
01:32:34.739 --> 01:32:38.050
You have fear, anger, despair in you, 

1187
01:32:38.099 --> 01:32:41.185
and if you do not know how to transform it, 

1188
01:32:41.234 --> 01:32:44.414
how can you help your beloved one to do the same? 

1189
01:32:44.465 --> 01:32:48.144
So understanding the suffering inside, 

1190
01:32:48.194 --> 01:32:51.480
and bring a relief and transformation, 

1191
01:32:51.529 --> 01:32:53.529
is very crucial for love. 

1192
01:32:53.579 --> 01:32:58.149
And then you will be able to help your beloved one 

1193
01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:02.560
transform the suffering. 

1194
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:07.180
So that is the 2. element of true love: 

1195
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:14.369
the capacity to help someone suffer less.

1196
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:20.994
And the 3. element of true love is joy (Muditā), 

1197
01:33:21.045 --> 01:33:26.420
because true love always generate joy for you 

1198
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:28.550
and for the other person. 

1199
01:33:28.599 --> 01:33:34.619
If both of us cry during the process of loving, 

1200
01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:36.225
that is not true love. 

1201
01:33:36.274 --> 01:33:41.900
True love should bring joy every moment of our daily life. 

1202
01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:49.109
And mindfulness can help doing that.

1203
01:33:49.439 --> 01:33:57.315
And the 4. element of true love is inclusiveness (Upekṣā). 

1204
01:33:57.364 --> 01:33:59.189
In true love, 

1205
01:33:59.239 --> 01:34:01.645
there is no longer any frontier between 

1206
01:34:01.694 --> 01:34:03.664
you and your beloved one. 

1207
01:34:03.715 --> 01:34:06.829
Your suffering is his suffering. 

1208
01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.079
His happiness is your happiness. 

1209
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:16.454
And there is a perfect way of understanding 

1210
01:34:16.505 --> 01:34:18.529
between the two of you. 

1211
01:34:18.579 --> 01:34:23.405
And together you can serve and help many people. 

1212
01:34:23.454 --> 01:34:28.600
True love is the kind of love that always grows. 

1213
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.465
It has no frontier. 

1214
01:34:32.515 --> 01:34:35.545
And practising true love, 

1215
01:34:35.594 --> 01:34:43.690
you begin to embrace everyone, the whole planet, 

1216
01:34:43.739 --> 01:34:46.890
and bring a lot of joy to you.

1217
01:34:46.939 --> 01:34:52.189
And that is why we have to know where we go. 

1218
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:56.245
If love is our destination, 

1219
01:34:56.295 --> 01:34:59.485
and then we have to sacrifice other things, 

1220
01:34:59.534 --> 01:35:01.585
that are not love, like: 


1221
01:35:01.635 --> 01:35:03.144
fame,

1222
01:35:03.194 --> 01:35:04.760
wealth,

1223
01:35:04.809 --> 01:35:07.060
sensual pleasure,

1224
01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:10.074
power.

1225
01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:12.085
Because there are those, 

1226
01:35:12.134 --> 01:35:17.420
who have plenty of these things, and who suffer very deeply.

1227
01:35:20.829 --> 01:35:31.039
And when I was ordained as a monk at the age of 16, 

1228
01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:35.675
my teacher gave me the Dharma name: 

1229
01:35:35.725 --> 01:35:37.855
Nhất Hạnh, which means: 

1230
01:35:37.904 --> 01:35:41.750
one action - you do only one thing. 

1231
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:49.420
You don't do many things at the same time - mono-tasking. 

1232
01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:01.560
And I tried to live according to this teaching. 

1233
01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.835
I want to transform myself. 

1234
01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:09.045
I want to help people be happy. 

1235
01:36:09.094 --> 01:36:12.130
Because I know that, if people are happy, 

1236
01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.529
I can be happy also. 

1237
01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:27.670
And that is why Buddhist meditation is made of 2 elements: 

1238
01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.079
the 1. element is concentration. 

1239
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:40.619
You focus your attention just on one thing. 

1240
01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:46.095
Otherwise your concentration is not 

1241
01:36:46.144 --> 01:36:52.680
powerful enough to get a breakthrough, and get a insight. 

1242
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.010
And concentration can be practised, 

1243
01:36:57.059 --> 01:37:01.489
not by thinking, but by:


1244
01:37:01.539 --> 01:37:03.750
brushing your teeth in mindfulness,

1245
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.640
washing your dishes in mindfulness,

1246
01:37:06.689 --> 01:37:12.505
watering the vegetables in mindfulness,

1247
01:37:12.554 --> 01:37:14.104
enjoying every step.

1248
01:37:14.154 --> 01:37:18.400
That will make the concentration more and more powerful, 

1249
01:37:18.449 --> 01:37:20.905
and your store consciousness will bring, 

1250
01:37:20.954 --> 01:37:24.720
will offer the insight, that you need. 

1251
01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:31.655
And that is why the 1. element of Buddhist 

1252
01:37:31.704 --> 01:37:35.140
meditation is Samādhi concentration, 

1253
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:40.079
and the 2. is Vipassanā. 

1254
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:44.670
It means looking deeply. 

1255
01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.625
You concentrate on just one thing. 

1256
01:37:47.675 --> 01:37:50.875
And you only look deeply into that one thing. 

1257
01:37:50.924 --> 01:37:56.850
And that is the technique, is secret of bringing up insight.

1258
01:37:57.270 --> 01:38:03.375
I think concerning information, we know that, 

1259
01:38:03.425 --> 01:38:04.664
we have the feeling, 

1260
01:38:04.714 --> 01:38:08.690
that we are overwhelmed by information. 

1261
01:38:08.739 --> 01:38:11.180
We don't need that much information. 

1262
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:13.779
We just need a few. 

1263
01:38:13.979 --> 01:38:16.545
And there are basic information, 

1264
01:38:16.595 --> 01:38:23.414
that we should maintain alive. 

1265
01:38:23.465 --> 01:38:25.495
Because there are many things we know, 

1266
01:38:25.545 --> 01:38:28.500
but we never but into practise. 

1267
01:38:28.829 --> 01:38:32.035
So your happiness does not depend on how 

1268
01:38:32.085 --> 01:38:35.175
much information you have, but how, 

1269
01:38:35.224 --> 01:38:38.020
what kind of information, that you have, 

1270
01:38:38.069 --> 01:38:43.899
and how you put into practise that kind of information. 

1271
01:38:45.489 --> 01:38:48.325
And basic information is: 

1272
01:38:48.375 --> 01:38:52.779
that we are alive. 

1273
01:38:53.039 --> 01:38:57.489
Breathing in, I know I am alive. 

1274
01:38:58.770 --> 01:39:00.989
And breathing out, 

1275
01:39:01.039 --> 01:39:04.664
I can touch all wonders of life in me and 

1276
01:39:04.714 --> 01:39:06.704
around me in this moment.

1277
01:39:06.755 --> 01:39:10.300
And that can cultivate my happiness, 

1278
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:13.440
that can make me an instrument of love, 

1279
01:39:13.489 --> 01:39:16.979
and I can help, I can love.

1280
01:39:17.439 --> 01:39:22.235
So let us have the rest of our time for a few questions. 

1281
01:39:22.284 --> 01:39:23.779
Thank you.

1282
01:39:23.829 --> 01:39:33.489
[Applause]

1283
01:39:37.489 --> 01:40:08.439
[Gong]

1284
01:40:19.739 --> 01:40:33.760
[Organisational]

1285
01:40:33.809 --> 01:40:35.000
Hi. 

1286
01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:36.460
Oh, it works. 

1287
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:40.614
Thank you for being fully present here for us. 

1288
01:40:40.664 --> 01:40:44.795
I have a question about mindful walking. 

1289
01:40:44.845 --> 01:40:48.320
I am pregnant, so when I am walking, 

1290
01:40:48.369 --> 01:40:52.500
my hip really hurts, and my knees, they all hurt. 

1291
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:54.859
So if I do mindful walking, 

1292
01:40:54.909 --> 01:40:58.595
does that means I focus on my painful knees, 

1293
01:40:58.644 --> 01:40:59.965
and my painful hips, 

1294
01:41:00.014 --> 01:41:03.045
and shouldn't I just think about something 

1295
01:41:03.094 --> 01:41:06.020
else and get distracted?

1296
01:41:08.859 --> 01:41:12.984
You may join us sitting on a chair, 

1297
01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:14.285
and someone can push you, 

1298
01:41:14.335 --> 01:41:19.295
and you can profit from the collective 

1299
01:41:19.344 --> 01:41:21.730
energy of peace and joy. 

1300
01:41:21.779 --> 01:41:27.649
And you do walking meditation with your feet later, 

1301
01:41:27.699 --> 01:41:35.880
but now you can sit on a chair and have someone push you. 

1302
01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:37.869
This is possible.

1303
01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.699
So this is not the right time for me to do mindful walking?!

1304
01:41:43.859 --> 01:41:50.159
I think at least you can enjoy a few steps. 

1305
01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:52.664
You can always enjoy a few steps. 

1306
01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:57.210
But when it becomes difficult, tiring, you can stop.

1307
01:41:58.359 --> 01:41:59.739
Thank you.

1308
01:41:59.789 --> 01:42:01.100
Yes.

1309
01:42:03.289 --> 01:42:09.505
There are practitioners of meditation who could not walk. 

1310
01:42:09.555 --> 01:42:13.140
But they like to join us during walking meditation. 

1311
01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:20.265
They bring along their wheelchair, 

1312
01:42:20.314 --> 01:42:23.890
and they enjoy the Sangha, 

1313
01:42:23.939 --> 01:42:28.300
and the collective energy generated by the practise.

1314
01:42:31.119 --> 01:42:33.240
Hello. 

1315
01:42:33.289 --> 01:42:35.939
This one works here. 

1316
01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:42.010
So, my name is Alex Aris. 

1317
01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:44.600
I am working at Google. 

1318
01:42:44.649 --> 01:42:49.985
And so, my question is not necessarily my question, 

1319
01:42:50.034 --> 01:42:52.555
but it could be maybe a typical Googler. 

1320
01:42:52.604 --> 01:42:55.550
But I think this is very relevant. 

1321
01:42:55.599 --> 01:42:56.940
So you said: 

1322
01:42:56.989 --> 01:43:00.364
if you practise mindfulness, this is good, 

1323
01:43:00.414 --> 01:43:04.840
but I am thinking, how we can apply this in Google. 

1324
01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:09.020
So I think a typical Googler would think about, 

1325
01:43:09.069 --> 01:43:11.835
well, you know, if I practise mindfulness, 

1326
01:43:11.884 --> 01:43:14.250
then I think I am going to lose a lot of time. 

1327
01:43:14.299 --> 01:43:17.064
Because you mentioned, you know:


1328
01:43:17.114 --> 01:43:19.399
Do your breakfast with mindfulness, 

1329
01:43:19.449 --> 01:43:21.800
so don't think about the projects.

1330
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:26.295
And get the chance to get in touch with your life.

1331
01:43:26.345 --> 01:43:28.060
Don't multitask.

1332
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:30.470
Don't eat quickly.

1333
01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:33.640
Don't do a task while eating.

1334
01:43:33.689 --> 01:43:35.375
But there are many people, 

1335
01:43:35.424 --> 01:43:37.910
who use their laptops while eating. 

1336
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.670
So and then, they would be concerned: 

1337
01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.055
what am I gonna do, 

1338
01:43:46.104 --> 01:43:49.789
that I am gonna be losing a lot of this time. 

1339
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.645
And even if they are not concerned that 

1340
01:43:52.694 --> 01:43:53.865
they will be losing their time, 

1341
01:43:53.914 --> 01:43:55.935
they will be concerned that other people 

1342
01:43:55.984 --> 01:43:59.625
will think that they are spending too 

1343
01:43:59.674 --> 01:44:03.505
much time eating breakfast, or doing other things, 

1344
01:44:03.554 --> 01:44:05.245
and not thinking about their projects. 

1345
01:44:05.295 --> 01:44:05.605
And so: 

1346
01:44:05.654 --> 01:44:07.454
What will my team think about me? 

1347
01:44:07.504 --> 01:44:12.060
What will the performance review be about me? 

1348
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:16.800
So will they say he didn't spend enough time and so on. 

1349
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:23.615
So how do you, you know, reply to these concerns, 

1350
01:44:23.664 --> 01:44:27.920
thinking if we would apply this in Google.

1351
01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.529
I have said that: 

1352
01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:42.354
usually our thinking may be not very productive. 

1353
01:44:42.404 --> 01:44:46.029
Our thinking is sometimes very productive, 

1354
01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:48.130
but not always productive. 

1355
01:44:48.179 --> 01:44:52.909
And our thinking may lead us away. 

1356
01:44:54.869 --> 01:44:58.189
That is one thing I said. 

1357
01:44:58.239 --> 01:45:06.995
And thinking is not the only way to succeed in finding out, 

1358
01:45:07.045 --> 01:45:09.905
what you want to find out. 

1359
01:45:09.954 --> 01:45:12.465
The 2. thing I said is that: 

1360
01:45:12.514 --> 01:45:14.765
while you are brushing your teeth mindfully, 

1361
01:45:14.814 --> 01:45:18.215
and eating your breakfast mindfully, 

1362
01:45:18.264 --> 01:45:20.380
although you do not think about it, 

1363
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:24.605
but your store consciousness continues to work on it. 

1364
01:45:24.654 --> 01:45:28.805
You have to rely on your store consciousness. 

1365
01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:33.155
If one day you can invent something, 

1366
01:45:33.204 --> 01:45:37.824
that is the work of store consciousness. 

1367
01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:44.680
And many famous scientists have reported that their insight came, 

1368
01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:49.100
when they did not think.

1369
01:45:49.899 --> 01:45:52.439
Thank you.

1370
01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.265
Thay, here, my name is Ming. 

1371
01:45:57.314 --> 01:45:59.675
I don't do anything and I hope to do even 

1372
01:45:59.724 --> 01:46:01.880
less when I grow up. 

1373
01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.899
My question for you: 

1374
01:46:04.949 --> 01:46:08.935
For me, you are a simple perfection, 

1375
01:46:08.984 --> 01:46:11.654
as a practitioner - in my opinion, 

1376
01:46:11.704 --> 01:46:13.619
and I find that very inspiring. 

1377
01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:17.920
But ironically, I find most inspiring, 

1378
01:46:17.970 --> 01:46:20.074
when you are not perfect. 

1379
01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:22.494
And the example of that is: 

1380
01:46:22.545 --> 01:46:24.449
I read in your books somewhere, 

1381
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:25.850
that there was a moment, 

1382
01:46:25.899 --> 01:46:28.539
when you got angry at somebody, and than 

1383
01:46:28.590 --> 01:46:30.750
you got almost so angry, 

1384
01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.539
you almost wanted to stand up and shoot the guy, 

1385
01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:36.579
but you didn't, because you are a symbol of peace. 

1386
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:42.195
And I found that very inspiring, because to me I said: 

1387
01:46:42.244 --> 01:46:44.320
even Thich Nhat Hanh has anger. 

1388
01:46:44.369 --> 01:46:48.515
And so my question is, 

1389
01:46:48.564 --> 01:46:52.355
I want you to talk a little bit about your imperfection. 

1390
01:46:52.404 --> 01:46:56.609
And hopefully your imperfection will inspire all of us.

1391
01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.710
This is a very important question. 

1392
01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:08.979
The problem of happiness and suffering, 

1393
01:47:09.329 --> 01:47:16.369
the problem of perfection and non-perfection is the same. 

1394
01:47:20.789 --> 01:47:31.260
When I speak about the kingdom of god, I say that: 

1395
01:47:32.239 --> 01:47:35.295
the kingdom of god is not a place, 

1396
01:47:35.344 --> 01:47:38.454
where there is no suffering, to me. 

1397
01:47:38.505 --> 01:47:40.600
Because many people believe, 

1398
01:47:40.649 --> 01:47:42.715
that the kingdom of god should be a place, 

1399
01:47:42.764 --> 01:47:45.050
where there is no suffering. 

1400
01:47:47.199 --> 01:47:52.180
But according to this teaching and practise, 

1401
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:57.050
if there is no suffering, there will be no happiness. 

1402
01:47:57.199 --> 01:48:01.789
It is like, when you grow a lotus flower, you need the mud. 

1403
01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.439
If there is no mud, there is no lotus. 

1404
01:48:06.489 --> 01:48:13.360
So happiness is made of, we all know that, 

1405
01:48:13.409 --> 01:48:18.395
when you are happy, it means that you have understanding, 

1406
01:48:18.444 --> 01:48:20.400
love, and compassion. 

1407
01:48:20.449 --> 01:48:23.610
Without understanding and compassion, 

1408
01:48:23.659 --> 01:48:26.650
you cannot be a happy person. 

1409
01:48:26.699 --> 01:48:33.100
And understanding and compassion arise only out of suffering. 

1410
01:48:34.569 --> 01:48:39.800
When you begin to see the suffering in someone, 

1411
01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:45.760
and when you see that that person is helpless, 

1412
01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:49.590
he does not know how to handle suffering inside of him, 

1413
01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.635
he is a victim of his suffering and he 

1414
01:48:52.684 --> 01:48:56.570
make people around him suffer, including you. 

1415
01:48:56.619 --> 01:49:00.659
The moment when you begin to see that truth, 

1416
01:49:00.710 --> 01:49:04.105
and understand the suffering in that person, 

1417
01:49:04.154 --> 01:49:07.315
compassion arises in you. 

1418
01:49:07.364 --> 01:49:14.295
Understanding brings about love and compassion. 

1419
01:49:14.344 --> 01:49:17.814
And when you have compassion, 

1420
01:49:17.864 --> 01:49:20.755
you don't want to punish him anymore. 

1421
01:49:20.805 --> 01:49:25.190
Before that, you suffer, you are angry, 

1422
01:49:25.239 --> 01:49:28.670
but now because you have seen the suffering, 

1423
01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:31.074
you have understood the suffering, 

1424
01:49:31.125 --> 01:49:36.375
you are motivated by the desire to help him to suffer less. 

1425
01:49:36.425 --> 01:49:43.005
It means that you have made use of the suffering, 

1426
01:49:43.055 --> 01:49:50.994
in order to create understanding and compassion. 

1427
01:49:51.045 --> 01:49:54.949
We know that, without understanding and compassion, 

1428
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.130
no happiness is possible. 

1429
01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:03.265
That is why, we know also, 

1430
01:50:03.314 --> 01:50:06.315
that in the kingdom of god there is suffering. 

1431
01:50:06.364 --> 01:50:09.420
Where there is no suffering, no mud, 

1432
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:11.255
there is no lotus flower. 

1433
01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:13.600
Where there is no suffering, 

1434
01:50:13.649 --> 01:50:16.710
there will be no understanding and compassion.

1435
01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:19.755
So my definition of the kingdom of god is: 

1436
01:50:19.804 --> 01:50:22.949
the place where people know how to make 

1437
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.065
good use of suffering, 

1438
01:50:25.114 --> 01:50:28.810
in order to create understanding and compassion. 

1439
01:50:28.859 --> 01:50:31.935
It is like if we know how 

1440
01:50:31.984 --> 01:50:34.425
to make good use of the mud in order to 

1441
01:50:34.474 --> 01:50:36.725
produce beautiful lotus flowers. 

1442
01:50:36.774 --> 01:50:41.585
So happiness and suffering they lean on 

1443
01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:44.199
each other to manifest. 

1444
01:50:44.789 --> 01:50:49.729
Anger is a kind of mud. 

1445
01:50:50.039 --> 01:50:54.805
Despair is a kind of mud. 

1446
01:50:54.854 --> 01:50:59.025
And if you allow that mud to overwhelm you - 

1447
01:50:59.074 --> 01:51:00.250
well - you suffer. 

1448
01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.425
But if you know the practise, 

1449
01:51:02.475 --> 01:51:07.949
and then you can make good use of anger, 

1450
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.230
and despair, in order to create peace and happiness. 

1451
01:51:13.279 --> 01:51:16.560
As a organic gardener, 

1452
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:20.850
you know how to make good use of the garbage. 

1453
01:51:20.899 --> 01:51:24.970
You can create compost from the garbage, 

1454
01:51:25.019 --> 01:51:28.829
in order to nourish flowers and vegetables.

1455
01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:36.329
The same thing is true with suffering and happiness. 

1456
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:46.229
Thanks to the fact that you have suffered, 

1457
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.215
that you have ingredients in order to make happiness. 

1458
01:51:51.264 --> 01:51:55.739
Looking embracing, looking deeply at that suffering, 

1459
01:51:55.789 --> 01:51:57.800
embracing deeply that suffering, 

1460
01:51:57.850 --> 01:52:07.409
understanding arise, and you can create joy and happiness. 

1461
01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:18.399
That is why suffering plays a role in the making of happiness. 

1462
01:52:19.659 --> 01:52:23.675
What is wrong with the practise is that, 

1463
01:52:23.725 --> 01:52:25.430
when suffering is there, 

1464
01:52:25.479 --> 01:52:28.109
and if you do not know how to handle suffering, 

1465
01:52:28.159 --> 01:52:29.239
that is wrong. 

1466
01:52:29.289 --> 01:52:32.600
But it is not wrong to have suffering. 

1467
01:52:32.649 --> 01:52:34.045
To have suffering, 

1468
01:52:34.094 --> 01:52:38.860
and if you know how to make good use of the suffering, 

1469
01:52:38.909 --> 01:52:43.130
in order to create happiness, that is something good. 

1470
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.069
So we you have to distinguish between 

1471
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:54.404
good practise and bad practise. 

1472
01:52:54.454 --> 01:53:00.510
If it is normal that a human being has craving, 

1473
01:53:00.559 --> 01:53:06.265
has anger, has frustration, worries. 

1474
01:53:06.314 --> 01:53:10.204
But if that human being knows the practise of mindfulness, 

1475
01:53:10.255 --> 01:53:14.855
he or she will be able to make good use of that, 

1476
01:53:14.904 --> 01:53:16.779
and transform it into something else, 

1477
01:53:16.829 --> 01:53:19.405
like peace and understanding. 

1478
01:53:19.454 --> 01:53:24.090
So without suffering, without having anger, 

1479
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:34.050
and sadness, and despair, how could you create peace, 

1480
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.890
happiness and non-fear?

1481
01:53:37.079 --> 01:53:40.130
It is like the left and the right. 

1482
01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:44.760
If the left is not there, the right can not be there. 

1483
01:53:44.809 --> 01:53:48.274
And if politically you are on the left, 

1484
01:53:48.324 --> 01:53:52.425
you should not try to make the right disappear, 

1485
01:53:52.475 --> 01:53:54.039
because if the right disappears, 

1486
01:53:54.089 --> 01:53:56.184
you disappear at the same time. 

1487
01:53:56.234 --> 01:53:58.470
So we should that have that 

1488
01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:03.475
non-dualistic way of looking at things. 

1489
01:54:03.524 --> 01:54:09.710
It is because you have anger, despair, 

1490
01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.865
suffering, 

1491
01:54:10.914 --> 01:54:14.795
that you have a chance to transform them 

1492
01:54:14.845 --> 01:54:19.619
into something better, peace, happiness and love.

1493
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:27.204
Thay, hello. 

1494
01:54:27.255 --> 01:54:28.275
Thanks for being here. 

1495
01:54:28.324 --> 01:54:32.825
I as a person who has struggled with depression in the past, 

1496
01:54:32.875 --> 01:54:35.800
so I am wondering if you have anything in particular to say 

1497
01:54:35.849 --> 01:54:37.875
about mental illnesses, 

1498
01:54:37.924 --> 01:54:40.725
and how mindfulness can play a role 

1499
01:54:40.774 --> 01:54:43.980
in helping people who struggle with that. 

1500
01:54:44.029 --> 01:54:45.649
Thanks.

1501
01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:53.314
Mental illness is like another kind of illness. 

1502
01:54:53.364 --> 01:54:56.640
They have their roots. 

1503
01:54:57.689 --> 01:55:02.060
Suppose we speak of a depression. 

1504
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:09.475
Depression does not come by itself alone. 

1505
01:55:09.524 --> 01:55:12.784
If we look deeply into the depression, 

1506
01:55:12.835 --> 01:55:16.590
we see the roots of depression. 

1507
01:55:16.699 --> 01:55:19.045
The Buddha said that: 

1508
01:55:19.095 --> 01:55:22.800
Nothing can survive without foot.

1509
01:55:23.819 --> 01:55:29.654
Your love, no matter how beautiful your love is, 

1510
01:55:29.704 --> 01:55:32.824
if you do not know how to nourish your love, 

1511
01:55:32.875 --> 01:55:34.050
to feed your love, 

1512
01:55:34.099 --> 01:55:37.465
it will turn to be something else latter on, 

1513
01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:39.314
like hate and anger. 

1514
01:55:39.364 --> 01:55:42.390
So love needs foot. 

1515
01:55:42.439 --> 01:55:44.659
Suffering also. 

1516
01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:51.000
Your depression also needs foot in order to be alive.

1517
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:53.819
We have lived in such a way, 

1518
01:55:53.869 --> 01:55:56.380
we have consumed in such a way, 

1519
01:55:56.429 --> 01:56:01.475
that make depression possible in the present moment. 

1520
01:56:01.524 --> 01:56:07.175
The way we have lived our daily life, 

1521
01:56:07.225 --> 01:56:09.725
in the last 6 months for instance, 

1522
01:56:09.774 --> 01:56:12.645
the kind of nutriments we have got, 

1523
01:56:12.694 --> 01:56:16.150
like fear, anger, despair, 

1524
01:56:16.199 --> 01:56:19.954
and we do not know how handle these. 

1525
01:56:20.005 --> 01:56:23.954
We have allowed them to be accumulated for a long time, 

1526
01:56:24.005 --> 01:56:27.994
that is why the depression has become a reality. 

1527
01:56:28.045 --> 01:56:30.355
The Buddha said that: 

1528
01:56:30.404 --> 01:56:34.220
What has come to be there, 

1529
01:56:34.269 --> 01:56:36.640
if you know how to look deeply, 

1530
01:56:36.689 --> 01:56:39.895
and to identify the source of foot, 

1531
01:56:39.944 --> 01:56:41.170
the source of nutriment, that has brought it 

1532
01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:43.699
in, 

1533
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:48.215
after you have seen the roots and the 

1534
01:56:48.264 --> 01:56:53.659
source of nutriment of what has come to be, 

1535
01:56:53.710 --> 01:56:56.865
you already begin on your path 

1536
01:56:56.914 --> 01:56:59.340
of transformation and healing. 

1537
01:56:59.389 --> 01:57:05.270
Because if you know how to identify that kind of nutriment, 

1538
01:57:05.319 --> 01:57:11.485
that have brought your depression, 

1539
01:57:11.534 --> 01:57:17.755
you know how to cut that source of nutriments. 

1540
01:57:17.805 --> 01:57:22.890
And if you stop consuming that kind of nutriment, 

1541
01:57:22.939 --> 01:57:25.819
you deprive your depression of foot, 

1542
01:57:25.869 --> 01:57:31.135
and your depression will have to die in a few weeks, 

1543
01:57:31.184 --> 01:57:32.784
or in a few months. 

1544
01:57:32.835 --> 01:57:40.060
So that is why learning the art of mindful living, 

1545
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:46.920
we will not continue to ingest the kind of foot, 

1546
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:48.819
that we have.

1547
01:57:48.949 --> 01:57:53.454
The Buddha spoke about 4 kinds of nutriments (Āhāra Sutta):

1548
01:57:53.504 --> 01:57:55.335
edible food,

1549
01:57:55.385 --> 01:57:58.244
sense impressions, 

1550
01:57:58.295 --> 01:58:03.005
the kind of food that you consume not by the mouth, 

1551
01:58:03.055 --> 01:58:08.100
but by eyes, ear and mind. 

1552
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:10.704
There are many toxic things that we consume 

1553
01:58:10.754 --> 01:58:12.694
in our daily life.

1554
01:58:12.744 --> 01:58:17.595
And the 3. kind of food is volition. 

1555
01:58:17.644 --> 01:58:22.824
Your deepest desire, your deepest intention, is the food.

1556
01:58:22.875 --> 01:58:26.385
And also the 4. kind of nutriment, 

1557
01:58:26.434 --> 01:58:28.505
which is collective consciousness. 

1558
01:58:28.554 --> 01:58:30.250
If you live in a place, 

1559
01:58:30.299 --> 01:58:32.900
where there is a kind of collective energy of fear, 

1560
01:58:32.949 --> 01:58:36.450
anger, craving, hate, you consume.

1561
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:42.189
That is why refraining from consuming 

1562
01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:46.970
nutriments that are toxic, 

1563
01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:54.619
you deprive your depression of foot, 

1564
01:58:54.670 --> 01:59:01.954
and your depression will have to die in a few weeks. 

1565
01:59:02.005 --> 01:59:10.635
That is why all mental illness are like that also. 

1566
01:59:10.685 --> 01:59:15.704
We have allowed ourselves to in the toxic environment. 

1567
01:59:15.754 --> 01:59:19.300
We have allowed ourselves to consume items, 

1568
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:24.050
that contain craving, anger, fear, despair, 

1569
01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:31.480
that is why these symptoms of mental illness have appeared. 

1570
01:59:31.529 --> 01:59:35.490
And the way we deal with our sickness: 

1571
01:59:35.539 --> 01:59:38.420
we try to suppress them. 

1572
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:42.909
When the suffering comes up, 

1573
01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.779
we do not allow them to come up, 

1574
01:59:45.829 --> 01:59:50.495
we try to suppress them, by the way of consuming, 

1575
01:59:50.545 --> 01:59:52.385
we want to cover them up. 

1576
01:59:52.434 --> 01:59:56.770
And we create a situation of bad circulation 

1577
01:59:56.819 --> 01:59:58.414
in our consciousness. 

1578
01:59:58.465 --> 02:00:04.635
And that is why symptoms of mental illness begin to appear. 

1579
02:00:04.685 --> 02:00:07.590
But if you know how to practise mindfulness:


1580
02:00:07.639 --> 02:00:10.439
you allow the pain the come up,

1581
02:00:10.489 --> 02:00:12.859
and you embrace tenderly your pain,

1582
02:00:12.909 --> 02:00:13.835
and recognise it,

1583
02:00:13.885 --> 02:00:16.329
and look into it. 

1584
02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:19.295
And than your pain will 

1585
02:00:19.344 --> 02:00:22.435
be embraced by that energy of mindfulness, 

1586
02:00:22.484 --> 02:00:28.295
concentration, compassion, and will go down, 

1587
02:00:28.345 --> 02:00:30.475
losing some of its strength.

1588
02:00:30.524 --> 02:00:32.250
And next time when it comes up, 

1589
02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:33.720
you allow it to come up, 

1590
02:00:33.769 --> 02:00:38.935
because you know how to handle it, handling the pain.

1591
02:00:38.984 --> 02:00:42.640
And after a few weeks of practising like that, 

1592
02:00:42.689 --> 02:00:44.550
you create, 

1593
02:00:44.599 --> 02:00:48.310
you restore a state of good circulation 

1594
02:00:48.359 --> 02:00:50.289
in your consciousness. 

1595
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:57.935
And the symptoms of mental illness will begin to disappear.

1596
02:00:57.984 --> 02:01:02.869
And that is why the practise of mindfulness can be very healing. 

1597
02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.010
Physically and also mentally.

1598
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:29.100
[Gong]

1599
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:31.565
Thank you so much for coming, 

1600
02:01:31.614 --> 02:01:33.914
and reminding us how easy it can be, 

1601
02:01:33.965 --> 02:01:37.470
to be happy and peaceful and loving. 

1602
02:01:37.779 --> 02:01:40.435
My question follows on something, 

1603
02:01:40.484 --> 02:01:42.225
that you said early on, 

1604
02:01:42.274 --> 02:01:46.345
regarding meditation as a combination of mindfulness, 

1605
02:01:46.394 --> 02:01:49.610
concentration, and then insight that arises. 

1606
02:01:49.659 --> 02:01:52.215
My question is about the insight. 

1607
02:01:52.264 --> 02:01:56.300
Having achieved an insight through meditation, 

1608
02:01:56.349 --> 02:02:00.944
does one expend effort to act on that insight, 

1609
02:02:00.994 --> 02:02:04.235
or does one simply hold the insight in mind, 

1610
02:02:04.284 --> 02:02:06.435
and allow this natural circulation that 

1611
02:02:06.484 --> 02:02:10.970
you speak of to transform the mind?

1612
02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:22.460
Insight can be maintained and nourished. 

1613
02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:34.180
Like insight can come just in the present moment. 

1614
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:40.855
Like in the exercise of mindful breathing: 

1615
02:02:40.904 --> 02:02:44.565
Breathing in, I feel alive.

1616
02:02:44.614 --> 02:02:49.534
So you touch the insight, that you are alive. 

1617
02:02:49.585 --> 02:02:54.085
And to be alive is a miracle. 

1618
02:02:54.135 --> 02:02:56.595
And that is why, when you breath out, 

1619
02:02:56.644 --> 02:02:59.935
you can enjoy, you can be happy, 

1620
02:02:59.984 --> 02:03:03.970
you can celebrate the fact that you are alive. 

1621
02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:08.050
But the practise of concentration 

1622
02:03:08.099 --> 02:03:10.850
can keep the insight alive. 

1623
02:03:10.899 --> 02:03:16.920
And if the insight is alive, happiness continues to be. 

1624
02:03:16.979 --> 02:03:22.725
If you allow the insight to go away, 

1625
02:03:22.774 --> 02:03:25.335
your happiness may go away also.

1626
02:03:25.384 --> 02:03:30.515
It is like the insight of inter-being. 

1627
02:03:30.564 --> 02:03:33.784
A father, looking deeply into his son, 

1628
02:03:33.835 --> 02:03:40.050
sees that he is fully present in every cell of his son. 

1629
02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:43.359
And if the son looks into himself, 

1630
02:03:43.409 --> 02:03:47.704
he can see that in every cell of his body, 

1631
02:03:47.755 --> 02:03:51.430
his father is fully present. 

1632
02:03:51.479 --> 02:03:57.425
And he gets the insight of father and son inter-are. 

1633
02:03:57.475 --> 02:04:01.450
You cannot remove father from son. 

1634
02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.810
You cannot remove son from father. 

1635
02:04:04.859 --> 02:04:08.170
That is the insight of inter-being. 

1636
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.605
And when the insight 

1637
02:04:10.654 --> 02:04:14.125
of inter-being between son and father is alive, 

1638
02:04:14.174 --> 02:04:17.215
anger is impossible, 

1639
02:04:17.265 --> 02:04:20.255
because when you get angry at your father, 

1640
02:04:20.305 --> 02:04:22.795
you get angry at yourself. 

1641
02:04:22.845 --> 02:04:25.890
You are a continuation of your father. 

1642
02:04:25.939 --> 02:04:29.314
If there is a young men, who says that: 

1643
02:04:29.364 --> 02:04:30.935
I hate my father. 

1644
02:04:30.984 --> 02:04:36.020
I don't want to have anything to do with that person.

1645
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:40.285
It means that that young man does not 

1646
02:04:40.335 --> 02:04:42.215
have the insight of inter-being. 

1647
02:04:42.264 --> 02:04:45.364
He does not know that his father is in him, 

1648
02:04:45.414 --> 02:04:48.914
and it is impossible to remove his father from him. 

1649
02:04:48.965 --> 02:04:53.600
If he removes his father from him, he is no longer there. 

1650
02:04:53.649 --> 02:04:58.175
And if that insight is in him, 

1651
02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:03.340
he knows that he has to reconcile with his father in him. 

1652
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:06.605
Because to say that: 

1653
02:05:06.654 --> 02:05:10.035
I do not want to have anything to do with that person.

1654
02:05:10.085 --> 02:05:14.765
is nonsense, because you are his continuation, you are him. 

1655
02:05:14.814 --> 02:05:17.525
How can you say that you do not have 

1656
02:05:17.574 --> 02:05:19.744
anything to do with him? 

1657
02:05:19.795 --> 02:05:24.274
To say that means you do not have the insight of inter-being. 

1658
02:05:24.324 --> 02:05:27.329
And the insight of inter-being not 

1659
02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:30.295
only liberates you from suffering, 

1660
02:05:30.345 --> 02:05:33.619
but shows you the way to behave, 

1661
02:05:33.670 --> 02:05:38.494
in order for harmony, for love, 

1662
02:05:38.545 --> 02:05:41.909
for happiness to be possible.

1663
02:05:50.789 --> 02:06:02.405
[Gong]

1664
02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:03.614
Hello. 

1665
02:06:03.664 --> 02:06:08.590
Thank you very much for your tender and conscious comments. 

1666
02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:11.035
One of the things, one of my passions, 

1667
02:06:11.085 --> 02:06:12.395
is working with children. 

1668
02:06:12.444 --> 02:06:14.310
And I had the opportunity to be in 

1669
02:06:14.359 --> 02:06:16.869
India last year working with small children. 

1670
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.315
And I was amazed at how, 

1671
02:06:19.364 --> 02:06:21.039
no matter what they have been through, 

1672
02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:23.375
they had this joy, and this compassion, 

1673
02:06:23.424 --> 02:06:25.600
and feeling of connection with community, 

1674
02:06:25.649 --> 02:06:28.160
even to the point, where they would write on our hands: 

1675
02:06:28.210 --> 02:06:31.155
When the world gives you a 1000 reasons to cry, 

1676
02:06:31.204 --> 02:06:33.954
show the world you have a million reasons to smile.

1677
02:06:34.005 --> 02:06:35.534
And I found it so beautiful. 

1678
02:06:35.585 --> 02:06:38.875
One of the thing I do is work with children in yoga, 

1679
02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:41.239
and visualisation, and creative play, 

1680
02:06:41.289 --> 02:06:42.545
and I find children in our 

1681
02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:46.285
community are already starting to multitask, 

1682
02:06:46.335 --> 02:06:48.585
and looking at the digital community, 

1683
02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:51.814
and getting very fragmented in minds. 

1684
02:06:51.864 --> 02:06:53.745
And one thing that I find works very very 

1685
02:06:53.795 --> 02:06:55.750
well is teaching through stories. 

1686
02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:58.140
And I was wondering if you had a sweet story, 

1687
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:59.859
that we may be able to share, 

1688
02:06:59.909 --> 02:07:01.234
even with our own children, 

1689
02:07:01.284 --> 02:07:04.275
helping to illustrate the power of mindfulness, 

1690
02:07:04.324 --> 02:07:08.060
or joy, compassion, maybe one of your favourites.

1691
02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:25.345
When I was small, 

1692
02:07:25.394 --> 02:07:29.605
I saw the drawing of a Buddha on the cover 

1693
02:07:29.654 --> 02:07:31.064
of a Buddhist magazine. 

1694
02:07:31.114 --> 02:07:33.420
The Buddha was sitting on the grass, 

1695
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:40.154
very peaceful, very happy. 

1696
02:07:40.204 --> 02:07:45.900
And I wished I can be someone like him, 

1697
02:07:45.949 --> 02:07:51.909
because around me people are nervous, unhappy. 

1698
02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:59.899
So the first time, when my school organised an outing, 

1699
02:07:59.949 --> 02:08:08.534
climbing a mountain, I was very excited, 

1700
02:08:08.585 --> 02:08:11.369
because we learned that there was a hermit 

1701
02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:16.390
practising on the mountain in order to become a Buddha. 

1702
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:20.485
I had not seen a hermit before, 

1703
02:08:20.534 --> 02:08:24.985
so I was very enthusiastic climbing. 

1704
02:08:25.034 --> 02:08:30.869
And we were organised in groups of 5 boys and of 5 girls. 

1705
02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:35.180
And many hundreds of us where climbing the mountains. 

1706
02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:38.255
We did not know how to practise walking meditation. 

1707
02:08:38.304 --> 02:08:42.920
We tried to climb as quickly as possible. 

1708
02:08:42.969 --> 02:08:46.289
And half the way, we drank all our water. 

1709
02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.235
We were very thirsty, 

1710
02:08:48.284 --> 02:08:51.700
when we came to the top of the mountain. 

1711
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:54.405
And the worst thing was, that I learned, 

1712
02:08:54.454 --> 02:08:57.579
that the hermit was not there. 

1713
02:08:59.949 --> 02:09:06.699
Perhaps he has heard that 500 students are coming. 

1714
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:10.465
It is not quiet enough for him, so he, 

1715
02:09:10.515 --> 02:09:17.314
maybe he had hidden himself somewhere in the mountain. 

1716
02:09:17.364 --> 02:09:20.420
So when we were given the order 

1717
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:24.970
to display our pick-nick and eat, 

1718
02:09:25.019 --> 02:09:28.180
I alone ventured in the wood, 

1719
02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:33.329
hoping that I can see the hermit. 

1720
02:09:33.949 --> 02:09:38.085
And I hear the sound of water dripping, 

1721
02:09:38.134 --> 02:09:43.784
and I followed, and I discovered a very beautiful natural well. 

1722
02:09:43.835 --> 02:09:46.810
The water was very limpid. 

1723
02:09:46.859 --> 02:09:50.215
And you know that I was very thirsty. 

1724
02:09:50.265 --> 02:09:53.515
I am so happy, I kneeled down, 

1725
02:09:53.564 --> 02:09:57.100
and cup the water, and drink. 

1726
02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:03.170
And suddenly a thought came to me: 

1727
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:09.855
I believed that the hermit has transformed himself into a well. 

1728
02:10:09.904 --> 02:10:16.530
So that I can have a private audience with him. 

1729
02:10:16.579 --> 02:10:19.409
And when you are small, 

1730
02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:23.614
and when you have read many fairy-tales, 

1731
02:10:23.664 --> 02:10:26.534
you believe things like that. 

1732
02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:31.675
And after I have drunk the water, 

1733
02:10:31.724 --> 02:10:37.710
I felt so peaceful, so happy, so fulfilled, 

1734
02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.800
that I did not feel any desire at all. 

1735
02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:49.529
Even the desire to meet the hermit as a person. 

1736
02:10:49.579 --> 02:10:53.090
And as I was very tired, I lay down, 

1737
02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:56.784
and I felt into a very deep sleep. 

1738
02:10:56.835 --> 02:11:00.215
I did not know how many minutes I slept, 

1739
02:11:00.264 --> 02:11:03.570
but when I woke up, I did not know where I were. 

1740
02:11:03.619 --> 02:11:05.565
It took time to remember, 

1741
02:11:05.614 --> 02:11:08.149
that the other boys were waiting for me. 

1742
02:11:08.199 --> 02:11:11.320
I left the place with a lot of regret. 

1743
02:11:11.369 --> 02:11:19.545
And I had to leave my beloved well and to go down. 

1744
02:11:19.594 --> 02:11:24.515
And in my mind, there is a sentence coming up: 

1745
02:11:24.564 --> 02:11:29.960
I have drunk the most delicious water in the world. 

1746
02:11:30.479 --> 02:11:35.359
And when I were back with the other children, 

1747
02:11:35.909 --> 02:11:39.715
I did not have the intention to tell them the story, 

1748
02:11:39.765 --> 02:11:47.210
that I have met the hermit in the form of a well. 

1749
02:11:48.449 --> 02:11:54.989
It sounds like, if I tell them - well - I lose something. 

1750
02:11:55.039 --> 02:12:00.395
My experience was kind deep spiritual experience, 

1751
02:12:00.444 --> 02:12:05.250
I wanted to keep by myself, to keep it long. 

1752
02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:14.135
And later on, when I grew up, I had the hope, that everyone I meet will have the chance to 

1753
02:12:14.184 --> 02:12:17.105
that everyone I meet will have the chance to 

1754
02:12:17.154 --> 02:12:22.970
meet his hermit also in their lifetime. 

1755
02:12:23.019 --> 02:12:25.829
Maybe you have met your hermit, 

1756
02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:28.159
but you have not recognised him. 

1757
02:12:28.210 --> 02:12:30.670
Your hermit may not be a well, 

1758
02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.065
but may be a rock, or a tree, or a child, or a mountain. 

1759
02:12:37.114 --> 02:12:40.815
But once you have got the hermit, you know where to go. 

1760
02:12:40.864 --> 02:12:43.005
And you begin your spiritual life, 

1761
02:12:43.054 --> 02:12:48.015
that can help you to overcome difficulties and find peace. 

1762
02:12:48.064 --> 02:12:52.525
And that is one of the stories I like to tell children, 

1763
02:12:52.574 --> 02:12:55.789
who come to Plum Village to practise.

1764
02:13:00.449 --> 02:13:02.550
Thank you very much.

1766
02:13:03.550 --> 02:13:07.550
