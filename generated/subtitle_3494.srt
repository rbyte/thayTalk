00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:23,414
Dear friends, in Plum Village France, 

2
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:27,219
where we live and practise, 

3
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:31,019
every time we hear the sound of the bell, 

4
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,947
we stop our thinking, we stop our talking, 

5
00:58:34,997 --> 00:58:38,626
and we go back to our in-breath, 

6
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:46,957
and breathe mindfully - and at least 3 times. 

7
00:58:47,007 --> 00:58:49,338
In. 

8
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:51,206
Out. 

9
00:58:51,256 --> 00:58:56,244
And that practise is called listening 

10
00:58:56,295 --> 00:59:01,098
to the bell of mindfulness. 

11
00:59:05,907 --> 00:59:12,605
When you hear the bell, you naturally stop your thinking. 

12
00:59:12,655 --> 00:59:15,170
It has become a habit. 

13
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,545
You naturally stop your thinking, 

14
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:24,485
and you focus your attention on your in-breath, 

15
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:27,683
and you enjoy breathing in. 

16
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:31,905
And when you breathe in mindfully like that, 

17
00:59:31,954 --> 00:59:35,707
you bring your mind home to your body. 

18
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:43,846
And you become fully alive in the here and the now. 

19
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:47,299
It takes only 3 seconds 

20
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:51,155
in order to bring the mind home to the body, 

21
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:56,059
and establish ourselves in the here and the now. 

22
00:59:56,109 --> 01:00:00,204
And when your are well established in the here and the now, 

23
01:00:00,255 --> 01:00:05,184
you can get in touch with life. 

24
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,809
First of all (5 Skandhas):

25
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,800
your body (rūpa),

26
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,010
your feelings (vedanā),

27
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:15,141
your perceptions (samjñā),

28
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:18,554
your mental formations (samskāra),

29
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:19,965
your consciousness (vijñāna).

30
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:24,869
And you get in touch with the wonders of life around you. 

31
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:38,170
The energy of mindfulness has the power to heal, 

32
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,309
to transform.

33
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,500
When you love someone, 

34
01:00:58,695 --> 01:01:05,853
you have the tendency to offer him or her something. 

35
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:11,960
You want to make him or her happy. 

36
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:23,460
And you are inhabited by the energy of love. 

37
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,815
And that is why 

38
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:34,639
you have the desire to make him or her happy. 

39
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:41,644
As I have said, love has the power to heal, 

40
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:47,659
to nourish, to bring happiness, and to transform suffering. 

41
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:53,150
And the practise of mindfulness can produce love. 

42
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:04,894
The real elements of true love can be 

43
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:08,364
produced by the practise of mindfulness. 

44
01:02:08,414 --> 01:02:11,639
And when you have that love in you, 

45
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:15,855
you are alive, you are peaceful, 

46
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:22,440
you are happy, and you can make the other person happy. 

47
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,340
Usually, when we want to make the other person happy, 

48
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:37,826
we want to give him or her something. 

49
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,625
We may write a poem for him, for her. 

50
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:50,065
Or we may cook something good and give to him or to her. 

51
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:53,690
Or you may go to the market and buy something. 

52
01:02:54,529 --> 01:03:00,630
But the most precious thing you can give him or her, 

53
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:05,329
is not something you can buy from the market, 

54
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:13,275
it is not something that you can buy with money - 

55
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:16,579
it is your true presence. 

56
01:03:19,188 --> 01:03:23,934
You have to be there for him and for her, 

57
01:03:23,984 --> 01:03:26,998
if you truly love him or her. 

58
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:29,960
And in order to be there, 

59
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,813
you need the practise of mindfulness. 

60
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:43,284
And what you want to offer your beloved one is 

61
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:45,400
your true presence. 

62
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:53,534
How can you love, if you are not there? 

63
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:57,070
True love means to be there for him or for her. 

64
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,693
And to be there is a practise.

65
01:04:00,994 --> 01:04:04,485
In the Buddhist tradition, 

66
01:04:04,534 --> 01:04:10,220
when you begin to breathe in mindfully, 

67
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:16,355
you bring your mind home to your body. 

68
01:04:16,404 --> 01:04:22,532
And when mind and body are together, you are truly there. 

69
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:26,425
In our daily life, very often, 

70
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:30,590
our body is there, but our mind is not there. 

71
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:34,624
We are not truly there. 

72
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:38,980
It is impossible to love, if you are not there. 

73
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:43,304
So practise mindful breathing, 

74
01:04:43,355 --> 01:04:46,789
bring your mind home to your body, 

75
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,356
can help you to be there. 

76
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:57,659
Our in-breath, our out-breath, 

77
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:02,301
is something like a bridge linking mind and body. 

78
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:05,775
And the moment when we pay attention to our in-breath, 

79
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:07,614
and breathe in mindfully, 

80
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:10,099
we bring our mind home to our body, 

81
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:15,278
and we are there - in just 2 or 3 seconds. 

82
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:21,742
And you can go to your beloved one, 

83
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:27,697
looking in his or her eyes, and you can say: 

84
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:30,125
Darling, I am here for you.

85
01:05:30,175 --> 01:05:33,239
Your presence is the most precious gift, 

86
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:36,461
that you can make to your beloved one.

87
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:49,804
There is an 11-year old boy, who is unhappy, 

88
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:52,710
because his father is not there for him. 

89
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,340
His father is a very rich businessman, 

90
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:02,353
successful businessman too. 

91
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:06,835
But he does not have time for himself, 

92
01:06:06,885 --> 01:06:14,480
for his wife, and his son. 

93
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:18,599
That day he said: 

94
01:06:18,648 --> 01:06:23,420
My son, tomorrow will be your birthday, right? 

95
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:25,585
Do you want anything? 

96
01:06:25,635 --> 01:06:27,599
I will buy it for you.

97
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:34,074
The young man did not know how to answer. 

98
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:36,664
He did not need anything. 

99
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:40,559
His father can afford to buy anything he wanted, 

100
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:43,250
but he did not need anything. 

101
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,440
He needed one thing. 

102
01:06:45,489 --> 01:06:47,989
The presence of his father. 

103
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:52,574
From time to time is father is there at home, 

104
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:56,135
but his mind is not with his body. 

105
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:59,710
So the young man has the impression, 

106
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,880
that he does not really have a father. 

107
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:05,885
So after some reflection he said: 

108
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:10,260
Daddy, it is you that I want!

109
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:16,944
And if the father knows the practise of mindful breathing, 

110
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:22,105
he will begin to breathe in mindfully, 

111
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:25,940
and it takes only 3 seconds for him to be there - 

112
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:27,735
body and mind together. 

113
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:30,490
And looking into the eyes of his son he said: 

114
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:32,639
Darling, I am here for you.

115
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,460
It is very easy. 

116
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,077
Everyone can do that.

117
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:46,310
To me, to love means to be there for your beloved one. 

118
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,529
And to be there, for me, is not a willing intention, 

119
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:55,588
a desire, that is a practise. 

120
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:59,595
In order to be there, you need to breathe in mindfully, 

121
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:01,982
and bring your mind home to your body. 

122
01:08:02,032 --> 01:08:06,114
Or you may like to practise walking meditation, 

123
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:08,144
mindful walking. 

124
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:16,904
While breathing in you make 1 step or 2 steps. 

125
01:08:16,954 --> 01:08:22,159
And you become aware of the step you make. 

126
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:28,489
You are touching life in the present moment with your foot. 

127
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:34,335
One step alone can bring you home to the here and the now, 

128
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:37,779
and be fully present in the here and the now. 

129
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:42,835
There are many ways of practise, that 

130
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,609
can help bring our mind home to the body, 

131
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:50,698
so that we can be established in the here and the now.

132
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:07,840
When you breathe in mindfully, 

133
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,359
and look at a flower like this one. 

134
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:18,935
You have an opportunity to get in touch with 

135
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:22,350
this flower deeply. 

136
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:31,270
You are mindful that the flower is there. 

137
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,880
Mindfulness is the kind of energy, 

138
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:39,300
that allows us to know what is there, 

139
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,061
what is happening in the here and the now. 

140
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,073
When you practise mindful breathing, 

141
01:09:45,122 --> 01:09:48,944
the object of your mindfulness is your in-breath. 

142
01:09:48,994 --> 01:09:51,185
Your in-breath is something that 

143
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:54,696
is happening in the here and the now. 

144
01:09:54,746 --> 01:10:03,335
And you may like to enjoy your in-breath also. 

145
01:10:03,385 --> 01:10:05,885
When you breath-in, 

146
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:09,085
and using the energy of mindfulness 

147
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:10,989
generated by your in-breath, 

148
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:16,109
you can recognise that flower as existing. 

149
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,210
And you get in touch with that flower. 

150
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,340
And if your mindfulness is strong enough, 

151
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:27,595
powerful enough, you are concentrated on the flower, 

152
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:29,625
and you get the insight: 

153
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:35,309
that that flower is a wonder, a wonder! 

154
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,885
And you may see that the 

155
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:47,413
flower belongs to the kingdom of god, 

156
01:10:47,463 --> 01:10:50,359
or the pure land of the Buddha.

157
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:57,838
And when you get in touch with flower, 

158
01:10:57,889 --> 01:11:01,177
you get in touch with the kingdom of god. 

159
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:04,467
And you get in touch with god, 

160
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,630
because god is always with his kingdom. 

161
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:17,922
And you may get the insight, 

162
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:19,635
that the kingdom of god is 

163
01:11:19,684 --> 01:11:22,598
available in the here and the now. 

164
01:11:22,648 --> 01:11:25,260
You don't have to look for it 

165
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:28,600
in the future or somewhere else. 

166
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:32,829
You don't need to die in order to go to the kingdom. 

167
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,962
In fact, you have to be very alive in order to do so. 

168
01:11:37,012 --> 01:11:41,042
And to be alive, to be fully present in the here and the now, 

169
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:45,009
you need only to breath-in mindfully, 

170
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:47,923
and it takes 2 or 3 seconds. 

171
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:52,590
So the kingdom of god is available to you, 

172
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,729
because you have the power, the capacity of being mindful. 

173
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:02,431
And the insight you get is: 

174
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:06,254
the kingdom is available in the here and the now. 

175
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:08,755
And you would like to make yourself 

176
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:11,337
available to the kingdom. 

177
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,493
And to make yourself available to the kingdom, 

178
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,765
that can be done very quickly: 

179
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:23,250
just breathe in mindfully, or making a step mindfully.

180
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:29,260
And then when you practise: 

181
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:33,130
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

182
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,520
This is the 3. exercise 

183
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:39,274
recommended by the Buddha in the Sutra of Mindful 

184
01:12:39,324 --> 01:12:40,542
Breathing (Ānāpānasati Sutta): 

185
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:45,859
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

186
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:49,002
Mindfulness of the body. 

187
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:52,305
You know that your body is there. 

188
01:12:52,354 --> 01:12:54,435
And while breathing in like that, 

189
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:58,109
you bring you mind home to your body - and there you are: 

190
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,649
alive, present. 

191
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,345
And you may discover, 

192
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:09,645
that your body also belongs to the kingdom of god. 

193
01:13:09,695 --> 01:13:16,479
Your body, like that flower, is a wonder. 

194
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:25,103
And you can touch the kingdom of god also in your body. 

195
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:29,979
You don't have to go far, and in the future, 

196
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:35,965
in order to get in touch with the kingdom of god. 

197
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:45,190
Mindfulness allowed us to be alive 

198
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:49,928
and to touch the wonders of life, 

199
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:53,065
inside of us, and around us. 

200
01:13:53,115 --> 01:13:58,399
And many of these wonders have the power to heal, 

201
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,270
to nourish. 

202
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,800
And you don't have to go to a temple 

203
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,516
in order to practise mindfulness. 

204
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:13,829
Walking from the parking lot to your office, 

205
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:19,415
you may enjoy the practise of mindful walking, 

206
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:23,177
you may like to enjoy every step, 

207
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:27,882
touching the wonders of live. 

208
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:31,600
That is something all of us can do.

209
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:38,519
Years ago, we offered a retreat for congressman in Washington DC. 

210
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:42,335
They have a hectic life. 

211
01:14:42,385 --> 01:14:48,779
And they need the practise of mindfulness in order to release the tension, 

212
01:14:49,096 --> 01:15:04,920
to relax, and to be in touch with life. 

213
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:13,149
Years after the retreat, 

214
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,590
they continued to practise mindful walking, 

215
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:25,675
and several of them wrote us, 

216
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,734
and said that from their office, 

217
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:30,460
where they work, to the place where they cast their vote, 

218
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:34,789
they always practise mindful walking 

219
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:41,579
and stop all thinking - just walking. 

220
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,505
And they say, 

221
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:52,649
that they survive that hectic life just by mindful walking.

222
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:58,270
So from the parking lot to your office, 

223
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,255
you may like to do like that: 

224
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:08,739
you stop all your thinking, and you enjoy every step. 

225
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:16,479
Walk in such a way, that every step can bring you freedom, 

226
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:27,760
can bring you solidity, freedom and healing. 

227
01:16:27,809 --> 01:16:33,225
Many of us use the practise of mindful 

228
01:16:33,274 --> 01:16:35,850
walking to heal ourselves. 

229
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,260
When you breathe in mindfully, 

230
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,914
and focus your attention on your breath, 

231
01:16:43,965 --> 01:16:46,239
when you make a step mindfully, 

232
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:49,055
and focus your attention on your step, 

233
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:52,819
you release the past, you release the future, 

234
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:55,260
you release all your projects, 

235
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:58,954
because your mind has only one object: 

236
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:04,590
that is your in-breath, or your step. 

237
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:09,585
One in-breath or one step can set you free! 

238
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:13,949
Free from the worries and the uncertainties 

239
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,654
about the future, 

240
01:17:15,704 --> 01:17:21,095
free from the regret and the sorrow concerning the past. 

241
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:26,385
The past may a prison, the future may be a prison, 

242
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:32,869
if you are subjected to regret, sorrow, fear, uncertainty. 

243
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,545
But when you focus your attention on your in-breath, 

244
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:39,550
you release everything. 

245
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,604
So one breath, one in-breath, set you free, 

246
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:46,095
one step made in mindfulness set you free. 

247
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:47,940
And when you are free, 

248
01:17:47,989 --> 01:17:52,805
your body has regained its power to heal itself. 

249
01:17:52,854 --> 01:17:55,970
And your mind also.

250
01:18:00,949 --> 01:18:03,710
I have said in the beginning that, 

251
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,395
when you love someone, 

252
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:10,715
you would like to offer him or her the best thing you have. 

253
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:13,164
The best thing, the most precious thing you have, 

254
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:15,319
is your presence. 

255
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,640
But your presence may have a higher quality:


256
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,274
you are fresh,

257
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,569
you are free,

258
01:18:24,619 --> 01:18:26,559
you are solid,

259
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:29,345
you are happy.

260
01:18:29,395 --> 01:18:32,979
And the practise of mindfulness helps you 

261
01:18:33,029 --> 01:18:39,539
to retain your freshness, to cultivate more peace, 

262
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,550
more solidity.

263
01:18:44,409 --> 01:18:50,914
There is a practise for children called Pebo[?] Meditation. 

264
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:53,704
There are 4 Pebos. 

265
01:18:53,755 --> 01:18:56,829
And children practise like this:


266
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:02,930
The 1. Pebo represents a flower. 

267
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:07,585
Breathing in, I see myself as a flower. 

268
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:11,130
Breathing out, I feel fresh.

269
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:17,479
The human being is a kind of flower. 

270
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,649
And if we do not know how to practise, 

271
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:29,284
and then we will lose our freshness, 

272
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:34,420
and we do not have much to offer the person we love. 

273
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,975
So practising mindful breathing or 

274
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:42,284
walking can restore your freshness, your flowerness. 

275
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,074
It is something possible. 

276
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:47,524
Releasing the worries, the fear, the anger, 

277
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,244
and restore your freshness. 

278
01:19:50,295 --> 01:19:55,640
It is something that we can do, while sitting or walking. 

279
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,244
The children practise: 

280
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,824
Breathing in, I see myself as a flower.

281
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:05,564
You don't have to imagine ourselves as a flower, 

282
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:11,625
because the human body, the human being, is very beautiful. 

283
01:20:11,675 --> 01:20:13,670
It is real flower. 

284
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,085
Look at a child. 

285
01:20:15,135 --> 01:20:17,029
Look at her face. 

286
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:23,204
Her tiny hand, his tiny foot, is a real flower. 

287
01:20:23,255 --> 01:20:25,600
It is beautiful when the child sleeps, 

288
01:20:25,649 --> 01:20:30,149
it is beautiful when the child is awake and plays. 

289
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:35,840
And we are born as flowers. 

290
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:40,635
And it is possible for us to preserve our flowerness, 

291
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:48,180
our freshness, our beauty.

292
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:50,835
The 2. Pebo: 

293
01:20:50,885 --> 01:20:55,220
Breathing in, I see myself as a mountain.

294
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:04,569
A mountain represents stability and solidity. 

295
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:07,715
A person cannot be a happy person unless 

296
01:21:07,765 --> 01:21:13,600
she has some stability, he has some stability. 

297
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,835
And the practise of mindful breathing, 

298
01:21:18,885 --> 01:21:19,909
mindful sitting, 

299
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,949
mindful walking can always help us to 

300
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,399
cultivate more stability and solidity. 

301
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,585
And our solidity, 

302
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:33,649
our stability is something we can offer 

303
01:21:33,699 --> 01:21:35,750
to the person we love. 

304
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:43,975
If we are too unstable, if we are not solid, 

305
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,649
we are not happy, 

306
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:52,729
and the other person suffers also because of that. 

307
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:56,795
So cultivating stability and solidity is 

308
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:58,779
something you can do.

309
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:05,309
Breathing in, I see myself as still water. 

310
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,420
Breathing out, I reflect things as they truly are.

311
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:16,899
When you are calm, you are not victims of wrong perceptions. 

312
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:22,690
You are not victims of anger and fear, 

313
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:24,764
because you are calm enough. 

314
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,529
You don't imagine things. 

315
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,470
So breathing in, breathing out, 

316
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:40,925
or practising walking, you can cultivate peace, 

317
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:43,880
calmness, tranquility. 

318
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:49,114
A person who does not have enough peace in himself, 

319
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:53,529
herself, cannot be a happy person. 

320
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,505
So cultivating peace in oneself is something 

321
01:22:57,555 --> 01:23:01,829
we can do with the practise of mindful breathing, 

322
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,309
mindful walking, mindful sitting. 

323
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:10,104
And when you have peace in you, 

324
01:23:10,154 --> 01:23:13,880
you have something to offer him or her.

325
01:23:14,109 --> 01:23:19,880
Breathing in, I see myself as space. 

326
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:22,690
Breathing out, I feel free.

327
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:29,204
If we do not have enough space in our heart, 

328
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:33,845
we have so much worries and fear and anger, 

329
01:23:33,895 --> 01:23:36,100
we are not happy. 

330
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:38,585
And that is why the practise is to bring 

331
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:41,579
more space into our hearts and around us. 

332
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:45,449
A person cannot be a happy person unless 

333
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:51,854
she has some freedom, some space in herself or around her. 

334
01:23:51,904 --> 01:23:57,055
So to love means to offer space. 

335
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:00,085
And if you do not have space in you, 

336
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:03,725
how can you offer your beloved one this space?

337
01:24:03,774 --> 01:24:06,854
That is why the practise of mindfulness, 

338
01:24:06,904 --> 01:24:08,975
whether that is mindfulness of breathing, 

339
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:15,475
or walking, or working, or eating, 

340
01:24:15,524 --> 01:24:25,739
always helps us cultivate these values, these energies. 

341
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:34,744
Or we can cultivate our beauty, our freshness. 

342
01:24:34,795 --> 01:24:41,625
We can cultivate more of our stability and solidity. 

343
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:48,079
We can cultivate more the energy of peace, calmness. 

344
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:51,819
And we can always cultivate more 

345
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:56,229
the element of freedom in us. 

346
01:24:56,279 --> 01:25:01,734
So when you look at your beloved one, and you say: 

347
01:25:01,784 --> 01:25:04,154
Darling, I am here for you.

348
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:06,000
that is great gift. 

349
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:11,930
Because your presence has the element of freshness, 

350
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:17,055
of stability, of peace and of freedom - 

351
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:22,399
the best kind of gift you can make to him or to her.

352
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:53,289
[Gong]

353
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,085
That presence generated by the practise of mindfulness, 

354
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:02,449
of breathing or walking - 

355
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:07,225
that presence is for you first, for us first, 

356
01:26:07,274 --> 01:26:10,295
and then for the other person. 

357
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:13,420
We have to be truly present, 

358
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:19,059
because love always begins with oneself. 

359
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:24,440
If you are not capable of loving yourself, 

360
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:26,774
of taking care of yourself, 

361
01:26:26,824 --> 01:26:33,734
you will not have the capacity to love the other person, 

362
01:26:33,784 --> 01:26:37,300
and take good take of him or her. 

363
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:42,055
And that is why loving oneself is the 

364
01:26:42,104 --> 01:26:45,289
foundation for loving the other person. 

365
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:48,994
And there are practises that everyone can 

366
01:26:49,045 --> 01:26:52,059
do in order to care for oneself, 

367
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,954
in order for us to be able to care 

368
01:26:55,005 --> 01:26:58,380
for the other person and for the world.

369
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:05,239
The Buddha proposed many easy, 

370
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:07,979
simple practises the everyone can do. 

371
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:13,159
Like the 1. exercise of mindful breathing: 

372
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:17,824
Breathing in, I know I am breathing in. 

373
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:20,895
Breathing out, I know I am breathing out.

374
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:24,434
You recognise your in-breath, 

375
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:26,434
you recognise your out-breath, 

376
01:27:26,484 --> 01:27:29,864
and since you have your in-breath as the 

377
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:32,199
object of your mind, you release everything else, 

378
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,454
you are free. 

379
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:38,085
Very simple exercise and the effect is great: 

380
01:27:38,135 --> 01:27:43,489
it set you free, just 3, 4 seconds of breathing-in. 

381
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,340
And you don't need to practise 

382
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:53,979
many months and many years in order to see the effect. 

383
01:27:54,029 --> 01:27:59,135
The first few minutes, when you begin the practise, 

384
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:02,145
you can see the outcome right away. 

385
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:06,574
Breathing in, if you pay attention only to your in-breath, 

386
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:09,850
and then you can release, end the past, 

387
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:12,795
end the future, and all your projects. 

388
01:28:12,845 --> 01:28:18,949
And the process of healing begins, right away!

389
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,449
The 2. exercise of mindful breathing is: 

390
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,670
Breathing in, 

391
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:29,229
I follow my in-breath from the beginning to the end. 

392
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:33,420
I follow my in-breath all the way through.

393
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:38,649
Your in-breath may only last for 3, 4, 

394
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:41,614
5 seconds, but while breathing in, 

395
01:28:41,664 --> 01:28:45,260
you are fully concentrated on your in-breath. 

396
01:28:48,109 --> 01:28:51,340
And you may enjoy breathing in, 

397
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:55,265
because breathing in is something enjoyable too. 

398
01:28:55,315 --> 01:28:59,190
You don't have to suffer while breathing in. 

399
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:03,340
If you suffer while breathing in, 

400
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:08,569
you are not practising correctly. 

401
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:11,994
Because life is a lot of suffering already in life, 

402
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:15,569
why do you have to practise in order to suffer more?! 

403
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,255
So, whether it is the practise of mindful breathing, 

404
01:29:22,305 --> 01:29:24,385
or mindful walking, mindful sitting, 

405
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:30,130
we do it in such a way, to give you pleasure and happiness. 

406
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:34,760
The practise is pleasant, should be pleasant. 

407
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,364
And when the energy of mindfulness and 

408
01:29:39,414 --> 01:29:41,194
concentration are powerful enough, 

409
01:29:41,244 --> 01:29:44,494
you always get an insight. 

410
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:49,859
The insight can help liberate you from your afflictions, 

411
01:29:49,909 --> 01:29:56,340
like fear, anger, jealousy, despair and so on.

412
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:00,479
There are 3 kinds of energies 

413
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:04,340
that can be generated by the practise of mindfulness:


414
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:12,720
The 1. energy is mindfulness (Sati), 

415
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:16,385
which allows us to become alive, 

416
01:30:16,434 --> 01:30:19,739
to become present in the here and the now, 

417
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:25,635
and to be aware of what is happening in 

418
01:30:25,685 --> 01:30:27,520
the here and the now.

419
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,194
And the 2. kind of energy 

420
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:34,529
is the energy of concentration (Samādhi). 

421
01:30:34,579 --> 01:30:37,050
When you are very aware, 

422
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,690
when you are very mindful of something, 

423
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:43,125
you are naturally concentrated on that. 

424
01:30:43,175 --> 01:30:48,045
If you are aware, if you are mindful of your in-breath, 

425
01:30:48,095 --> 01:30:51,774
you will be concentrating on your in-breath. 

426
01:30:51,824 --> 01:30:56,279
So that is the meaning of the 2. exercise: 

427
01:30:56,329 --> 01:31:02,260
Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through.

428
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:06,914
So mindfulness can become powerful 

429
01:31:06,965 --> 01:31:09,465
because of the concentration 

430
01:31:09,514 --> 01:31:13,475
that is born from the practise of mindfulness.

431
01:31:13,524 --> 01:31:17,699
And when mindfulness and concentration are together, 

432
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:23,545
are powerful enough, you always get the 3. energy: 

433
01:31:23,595 --> 01:31:26,239
the energy of insight (Paññā). 

434
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:35,279
Insight in this case does not come from thinking, 

435
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:38,545
but from mindfulness. 

436
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:40,809
And during the time 

437
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:43,210
of practising mindfulness and concentration, 

438
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,524
you don't need to think, 

439
01:31:44,574 --> 01:31:48,590
you may like to stop the thinking altogether. 

440
01:31:52,029 --> 01:31:57,715
Insight is the outcome of non-thinking.

441
01:31:57,765 --> 01:32:04,344
When we breath in mindfully and with concentration, 

442
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:06,645
we may discover many things. 

443
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:10,265
We may discover the fact that we are alive. 

444
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:15,279
Many do not know that they are alive. 

445
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:22,180
They are there, but they are not alive, 

446
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:26,500
because they do not have mindfulness. 

447
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:31,125
So there is a very simple exercise: 

448
01:32:31,174 --> 01:32:36,604
Breathing in - mindfully - I feel alive.

449
01:32:36,655 --> 01:32:38,315
And that is the truth. 

450
01:32:38,364 --> 01:32:43,809
If someone is not alive, she cannot breath in anymore. 

451
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:49,765
So breathing in mindfully, you get the insight, 

452
01:32:49,815 --> 01:32:51,664
that you are alive. 

453
01:32:51,715 --> 01:32:56,829
And to be alive is the most wonderful thing. 

454
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,960
It is a miracle. 

455
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:02,800
It is the greatest of all miracles to be alive. 

456
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:08,710
And just 2 or 3 seconds breathing in can 

457
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,350
bring you that insight, that you are alive, 

458
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:14,255
and you touch the miracle of being alive. 

459
01:33:14,305 --> 01:33:17,715
And when you breath out you can celebrate 

460
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:20,210
the fact that you are alive. 

461
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:24,284
So happiness is possible, joy is possible, 

462
01:33:24,335 --> 01:33:27,610
just by one in-breath and one out-breath, and 

463
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:31,389
it is nourishing and healing.

464
01:33:36,409 --> 01:33:39,764
And breathing in mindfully 

465
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:46,229
like that helps you to touch many conditions of happiness, 

466
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:49,885
that have the power to heal, 

467
01:33:49,934 --> 01:33:53,250
and to nourish in us and around us. 

468
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:59,569
Suppose we breath in and we become mindful of our heart: 

469
01:33:59,619 --> 01:34:04,199
Breathing in I am aware of my heart.

470
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:08,600
Generating the energy of mindfulness, 

471
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:13,194
you use that energy of mindfulness to recognise the 

472
01:34:13,244 --> 01:34:15,299
presence your heart. 

473
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:19,989
You kind of embrace your heart with the energy of mindfulness. 

474
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:22,315
And you can discover the fact, 

475
01:34:22,364 --> 01:34:27,430
that your heart still functions normally. 

476
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:30,469
That is already an insight. 

477
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,954
And it is wonderful to have a heart that 

478
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:35,315
still functions normally. 

479
01:34:35,364 --> 01:34:39,010
There are those of us who only wish for that. 

480
01:34:39,059 --> 01:34:42,979
And their deepest desire may be just having 

481
01:34:43,029 --> 01:34:45,864
a normal heart like that. 

482
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:48,020
So breathing in, 

483
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:51,819
and having our heart as the object of our mindfulness, 

484
01:34:51,869 --> 01:34:55,139
we can feel grateful to our heart. 

485
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,704
And that is one of the conditions of 

486
01:35:00,755 --> 01:35:03,329
happiness that we are having. 

487
01:35:05,729 --> 01:35:08,125
And when the Buddha teaches 

488
01:35:08,175 --> 01:35:10,375
the practise of mindfulness of the body, 

489
01:35:10,424 --> 01:35:14,864
he advises us to get in touch with all parts of the body, 

490
01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:22,699
and smile and recognise these parts of the body.

491
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:33,295
There is an exercise of deep total relaxation that we 

492
01:35:33,345 --> 01:35:35,219
will try today. 

493
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,989
We put ourselves in the lying position, 

494
01:35:42,039 --> 01:35:44,835
and we begin to breath in and out mindfully, 

495
01:35:44,885 --> 01:35:47,850
and recognise parts of our body. 

496
01:35:47,899 --> 01:35:51,534
Its like a scanning our body, not with X-ray, 

497
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:54,114
but the ray of mindfulness. 

498
01:35:54,164 --> 01:35:58,030
You recognise your eyes. 

499
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,074
Breathing in, I am aware of my eyes. 

500
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:06,010
Breathing out, I smile to my eyes.

501
01:36:06,059 --> 01:36:10,309
Recognising the presence of your eyes. 

502
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,854
And you may get the insight that - well - 

503
01:36:13,904 --> 01:36:17,449
my eyes are still in good conditions. 

504
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:25,934
A paradise of forms and colours is available to me, 

505
01:36:25,985 --> 01:36:30,739
just because I still have eyes in good condition. 

506
01:36:30,789 --> 01:36:32,514
You need only to open your 

507
01:36:32,565 --> 01:36:38,045
eyes in order to touch the paradise of form and colour. 

508
01:36:38,095 --> 01:36:42,940
That is another condition of happiness.

509
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:48,500
And we go through the body, 

510
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,735
and we recognise every part of the body. 

511
01:36:51,784 --> 01:36:57,130
And when we come to a place that is a little bit ailing, 

512
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,309
we may like to stop longer, 

513
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:03,649
and embrace with compassion 

514
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:11,399
and tenderness the part of the body that is ailing. 

515
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:16,074
That practise of being aware of the body, 

516
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:19,940
can help heal the body. 

517
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:25,145
You can still continue with your medicine, 

518
01:37:25,194 --> 01:37:30,539
but to relax our body, 

519
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:35,074
to embrace tenderly that part of your body 

520
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:39,619
with mindfulness is a practise, can accelerate, 

521
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:42,505
can help very much the healing, 

522
01:37:42,555 --> 01:37:46,619
can make the healing happen more quickly. 

523
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,819
The 3. exercise: 

524
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:52,300
Breathing in, I am aware of my body.

525
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:55,210
is part of that exercise. 

526
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,844
And the 4. exercise is: 

527
01:37:58,895 --> 01:38:05,809
Breathing in, I release all the tension in my body.

528
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:13,120
The body has the power to heal itself 

529
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:17,610
only if we allow it to do that.

530
01:38:19,449 --> 01:38:25,145
When an animal in the forest gets deeply wounded, 

531
01:38:25,194 --> 01:38:28,170
she knows what to do. 

532
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:32,899
The animal finds a quiet place and lies down. 

533
01:38:33,159 --> 01:38:39,979
She knows deeply that resting is the only way to heal. 

534
01:38:40,029 --> 01:38:48,270
The animal does not think of looking for food, 

535
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:51,434
or running after an animal. 

536
01:38:51,485 --> 01:38:57,190
She knows that the best thing is to just lie down, 

537
01:38:57,239 --> 01:39:02,050
because the body has the natural tendency, 

538
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,434
natural power to heal itself.

539
01:39:06,485 --> 01:39:13,604
We human beings, we used to have that kind of wisdom, 

540
01:39:13,655 --> 01:39:17,090
but we have lost our capacity to rest. 

541
01:39:17,139 --> 01:39:19,825
We have worked our body too hard. 

542
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:23,895
We have accumulated a lot of tension in our body, 

543
01:39:23,944 --> 01:39:27,335
and make it more difficult for our body to heal. 

544
01:39:27,385 --> 01:39:37,430
We only count on medicines and other kinds of means. 

545
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:46,295
So the 4. exercise of mindful breathing is every helpful. 

546
01:39:46,344 --> 01:39:51,449
It helps us to be aware of our body. 

547
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:59,095
And our mind becomes embodied again, 

548
01:39:59,145 --> 01:40:03,010
and helps the body to release the tension. 

549
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:06,920
And when the tension is released, 

550
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:13,270
the body recovers that capacity to heal itself. 

551
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,345
So the practise of mindful sitting with relaxation, 

552
01:40:19,395 --> 01:40:22,069
the practise of mindful walking, 

553
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:29,274
the practise of mindful breathing while lying down, 

554
01:40:29,324 --> 01:40:33,630
can be very helpful, it can heal.

555
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:44,430
And we do not have to set aside time in order to do that. 

556
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:47,895
Just, as I said, 

557
01:40:47,944 --> 01:40:50,905
walking from the parking lot to the office 

558
01:40:50,954 --> 01:40:52,244
you have a time to practise: 

559
01:40:52,295 --> 01:40:55,895
releasing the tension, and enjoying every step, 

560
01:40:55,944 --> 01:40:56,674
and every breath, 

561
01:40:56,725 --> 01:40:59,620
and touching the kingdom of god 

562
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:03,050
around you and inside of you. 

563
01:41:03,149 --> 01:41:08,284
The only thing is that there should be 

564
01:41:08,335 --> 01:41:11,090
someone to remind you to do it. 

565
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:15,739
You may understand it perfectly but you don't do it.

566
01:41:16,909 --> 01:41:20,460
We live as a community. 

567
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:27,204
Our root practise centre is in France, 

568
01:41:27,255 --> 01:41:32,505
but in North America we have Deer Park 

569
01:41:32,555 --> 01:41:36,425
Monastery in southern California, Escondido. 

570
01:41:36,475 --> 01:41:40,905
And we have the Blue Cliff 

571
01:41:40,954 --> 01:41:44,750
practise centre in the state of New York. 

572
01:41:45,869 --> 01:41:50,735
And we live as a four-fold Sangha: 

573
01:41:50,784 --> 01:41:53,590
monks, nuns, and lay-practitioners. 

574
01:41:53,639 --> 01:42:01,149
And we practise together and we remind each other to practise. 

575
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,434
When we listen to the bell, 

576
01:42:03,485 --> 01:42:06,184
hundreds of us listen to the bell together. 

577
01:42:06,235 --> 01:42:09,034
When we sit together, and talk together, 

578
01:42:09,085 --> 01:42:10,985
we do that together. 

579
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:15,020
And breathing together, walking together, 

580
01:42:15,069 --> 01:42:16,505
sitting together, 

581
01:42:16,555 --> 01:42:20,684
we generate a very powerful collective 

582
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:28,050
energy of mindfulness, concentration, and compassion. 

583
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:34,965
And that helps heal us.

584
01:42:35,014 --> 01:42:38,835
When you find yourself in an environment 

585
01:42:38,885 --> 01:42:41,899
filled with that kind of energy: 

586
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:45,645
peace, mindfulness, compassion, 

587
01:42:45,694 --> 01:42:49,659
you get the healing very easily and quickly. 

588
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:55,725
I think a corporation can organise 

589
01:42:55,774 --> 01:43:00,369
also as a practise community. 

590
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:04,039
There are times when you can sit together, 

591
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:07,139
breath together, walk together, 

592
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:09,675
release the tension together. 

593
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:13,909
And together we can generate that kind 

594
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:19,110
of collective energy, that is very nourishing and healing. 

595
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:25,229
Our retreats of mindfulness are always attended by 

596
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:29,190
teenagers and children. 

597
01:43:29,239 --> 01:43:33,239
And there are practitioners who bring their babies. 

598
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:37,119
Although the babies do not understand the Dharma talk, 

599
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:41,850
but if they find themselves in an environment, 

600
01:43:41,899 --> 01:43:45,420
that is so peaceful, so compassionate, 

601
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,059
they get the nourishment, they feel it. 

602
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:59,050
So everyone can profit from the practise.

603
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,114
In a practise centre, 

604
01:44:03,164 --> 01:44:06,030
when you need to move from one place to another place, 

605
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,750
you always apply the techniques of mindful walking, 

606
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:18,649
no matter how short or how long the distance is. 

607
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:23,465
The practise is to arrive in the here and 

608
01:44:23,514 --> 01:44:25,770
now with every step. 

609
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:30,420
And touching the wonders of life with every step. 

610
01:44:30,469 --> 01:44:35,909
And while we walk, we do not talk, and we do not think. 

611
01:44:39,789 --> 01:44:43,225
When we stop our thinking, our talking, 

612
01:44:43,274 --> 01:44:47,869
we touch life more deeply, 

613
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,500
so that we can get the nourishment and the healing. 

614
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:02,619
And when... 

615
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:06,389
Let us enjoy breathing together.

616
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:45,350
[Gong]

617
01:45:45,979 --> 01:45:49,530
When you eat your breakfast, 

618
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:54,449
you have a chance to practise mindfulness of eating. 

619
01:45:54,590 --> 01:46:00,699
You don't have to think about your projects, your work. 

620
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:05,989
Every moment of breakfast 

621
01:46:06,039 --> 01:46:10,710
is an opportunity for us to get in touch 

622
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,250
with the wonders of life. 

623
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:22,979
Today we will have a chance to share 

624
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:26,130
a meal together in mindfulness. 

625
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:29,920
Holding a piece of bread, 

626
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:33,225
you may like to stop your thinking, 

627
01:46:33,274 --> 01:46:36,239
and look deeply into the piece of bread. 

628
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:41,590
Mindfully you breath in, 

629
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:46,475
and you may get in touch with the fact, 

630
01:46:46,524 --> 01:46:50,300
that the piece of bread, that you are holding, 

631
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:53,399
contains the whole universe! 

632
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:58,739
There is the sunshine, that helped the wheat to grow, 

633
01:46:58,789 --> 01:47:00,399
there is the cloud, 

634
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:04,324
that provided rain for the wheat to grow, 

635
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:08,255
the earth is in there, time, space, 

636
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:11,895
and everything of the cosmos has come together, 

637
01:47:11,944 --> 01:47:15,345
in order to help produce that piece of bread. 

638
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:18,295
And that insight you can get in just a few 

639
01:47:18,345 --> 01:47:22,380
seconds of looking mindfully at that piece of bread. 

640
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:26,045
If you keep thinking about the past, 

641
01:47:26,095 --> 01:47:29,395
or the future, or your projects, you miss the bread. 

642
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:32,235
You miss the kingdom of god, 

643
01:47:32,284 --> 01:47:36,690
that the bread is bringing to you. 

644
01:47:38,389 --> 01:47:42,539
And when you put the piece of breath in your mouth, 

645
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:45,375
you may like to enjoy just chewing the bread. 

646
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:48,819
Getting in touch with the wonders of life. 

647
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:51,784
Instead of chewing your projects, 

648
01:47:51,835 --> 01:47:58,039
your worries, your fear, you stop all your thinking. 

649
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:01,494
You just enjoy eating your breakfast. 

650
01:48:01,545 --> 01:48:03,649
And that is a practise. 

651
01:48:03,699 --> 01:48:09,360
You don't need to set aside time for practising.

652
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:13,485
When you take a shower, 

653
01:48:13,534 --> 01:48:16,625
that is time to practise mindfulness. 

654
01:48:16,674 --> 01:48:21,215
You may enjoy your mindful breathing, 

655
01:48:21,264 --> 01:48:26,469
and become aware of the water, of your body, 

656
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,229
and you can create the joy 

657
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:35,534
and happiness while taking a shower. 

658
01:48:35,585 --> 01:48:39,079
The essential is to stop thinking. 

659
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:43,864
The thinking will carry you away, 

660
01:48:43,914 --> 01:48:49,930
and does not allow you live that moment of life. 

661
01:48:51,069 --> 01:48:54,045
René Descartes said that: 

662
01:48:54,094 --> 01:48:55,895
I think, therefore I am.

663
01:48:55,944 --> 01:48:58,345
I am not very sure of that. 

664
01:48:58,395 --> 01:49:04,319
Because if you think so much, you go around your thinking. 

665
01:49:04,369 --> 01:49:07,664
Your thinking may not be productive at all. 

666
01:49:07,715 --> 01:49:10,215
It carries you to many realms, 

667
01:49:10,264 --> 01:49:16,639
and makes you worry more, angrier, and so on. 

668
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:20,975
So if you are carried away by your thinking, 

669
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,594
you are not there. 

670
01:49:22,645 --> 01:49:24,135
That is why: 

671
01:49:24,184 --> 01:49:27,420
I think, therefore I am not there.

672
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:33,979
It is better to stop the thinking in order to be there.

673
01:49:35,809 --> 01:49:39,034
When we brush our teeth, 

674
01:49:39,085 --> 01:49:43,800
we may choose to brush our teeth in such a way, 

675
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:47,260
that makes freedom, and joy, 

676
01:49:47,309 --> 01:49:50,045
and happiness possible during the time 

677
01:49:50,095 --> 01:49:51,524
of brushing our teeth. 

678
01:49:51,574 --> 01:49:57,844
I may take 2 minutes, or 3 minutes, 

679
01:49:57,895 --> 01:50:02,579
and the essential is to stop your thinking, 

680
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:06,309
even if you have a lot of things to do - 

681
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:13,199
stop your thinking, and enjoy brushing your teeth. 

682
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,420
When I brush my teeth I 

683
01:50:17,469 --> 01:50:22,305
usually touch the fact that I am over 80, 

684
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:25,319
and still have some teeth to brush, 

685
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:29,180
and that is enough to make me happy. 

686
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:32,735
Brush your teeth in such a way, 

687
01:50:32,784 --> 01:50:37,020
that freedom is possible, 

688
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:41,284
joy and happiness be possible during the time 

689
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:42,880
of tooth-brush. 

690
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:45,255
That is a challenge. 

691
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:49,569
And I know you can do it. 

692
01:50:49,819 --> 01:50:54,059
Do not think about your work, your projects. 

693
01:50:54,109 --> 01:50:58,885
Just enjoy being there and brush your teeth. 

694
01:50:58,934 --> 01:51:03,869
That moment, you can live it deeply also, 

695
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:10,840
because you can always touch the wonders of life, 

696
01:51:11,539 --> 01:51:16,119
the kingdom of god, in the here and the now.

697
01:51:22,899 --> 01:51:29,889
We used to distinguish between time for work and free time. 

698
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:37,989
Let us change our way of thinking. 

699
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:46,260
Suppose you have some free time. 

700
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:52,914
And if you do not know how to make use of your free time, 

701
01:51:52,965 --> 01:51:55,369
your time is not truly free. 

702
01:51:55,420 --> 01:52:00,094
If you keep thinking, and worrying, 

703
01:52:00,145 --> 01:52:05,319
that time does not make you happy. 

704
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,375
That time is not for working of course, 

705
01:52:14,425 --> 01:52:16,789
but you continue to think about it, 

706
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,399
you continue to worry about, 

707
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,340
and that thinking is not productive. 

708
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:39,940
It is very important to learn how to release, 

709
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:44,569
and to be fully in the moment.

710
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:57,510
And watering the vegetable garden, 

711
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:09,210
in the backyard, you may like to be fully present with that. 

712
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:14,280
Cooking breakfast, 

713
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:15,385
you may like to 

714
01:53:15,434 --> 01:53:20,180
make breakfast cooking into a session of meditation. 

715
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:24,604
You can enjoy every minute of breakfast making. 

716
01:53:24,654 --> 01:53:29,414
You don't try to do it quickly in order to have breakfast. 

717
01:53:29,465 --> 01:53:31,944
Or doing the dishes. 

718
01:53:31,994 --> 01:53:35,795
You can enjoy deeply every second of doing dishes. 

719
01:53:35,845 --> 01:53:38,170
And don't have to try to finish 

720
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:41,414
quickly in order to do other things. 

721
01:53:41,465 --> 01:53:44,155
We have the tendency to rush, 

722
01:53:44,204 --> 01:53:48,590
to finish quickly with with what we are doing. 

723
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:51,444
It has become a habit. 

724
01:53:51,494 --> 01:53:54,975
And with mindfulness of breathing, 

725
01:53:55,024 --> 01:53:57,090
you can recognise that habit, 

726
01:53:57,139 --> 01:54:00,005
and then help you to stop being carried 

727
01:54:00,055 --> 01:54:05,619
away by that kind of attitude.

728
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:11,649
Suppose you are washing dishes, 

729
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:14,735
and you want to finish in order to sit down, 

730
01:54:14,784 --> 01:54:17,729
and enjoy a cup of tea. 

731
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:23,380
With the practise of mindfulness, 

732
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:26,774
you can make the time of dish-washing 

733
01:54:26,824 --> 01:54:30,950
a beautiful time also, a joyful time, 

734
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,350
when being fully alive. 

735
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,860
And if you are not capable of doing so, 

736
01:54:37,909 --> 01:54:40,715
when you finish washing dishes, and sit down, 

737
01:54:40,764 --> 01:54:42,284
and hold the cup of tea, 

738
01:54:42,335 --> 01:54:43,485
you will think of other things - 

739
01:54:43,534 --> 01:54:45,850
you will not be able to enjoy your tea. 

740
01:54:45,899 --> 01:54:48,965
You are always carried away. 

741
01:54:49,014 --> 01:54:51,840
You are not capable of living your live 

742
01:54:51,889 --> 01:54:53,659
in the present moment. 

743
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:56,889
And mindfulness helps us to live deeply 

744
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:59,395
every moment of our daily life. 

745
01:54:59,444 --> 01:55:02,569
And we need some training in order to do so. 

746
01:55:02,619 --> 01:55:07,055
If we have a chance to live with a community of practise, 

747
01:55:07,104 --> 01:55:12,174
and then we get that habit of living deeply each moment 

748
01:55:12,225 --> 01:55:14,069
of our daily life.

749
01:55:18,969 --> 01:55:23,059
In Buddhist meditation, 

750
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:33,739
we know that insight is the factor, 

751
01:55:33,789 --> 01:55:41,380
that can help us transform afflictions like anger, 

752
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:43,869
fear, despair. 

753
01:55:44,329 --> 01:55:49,380
Insight is the kind of energy that can liberate us. 

754
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:57,739
And we know that insight is not the outcome of thinking. 

755
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:01,235
We have the thinking mind, 

756
01:56:01,284 --> 01:56:06,380
but our consciousness is more then the thinking mind. 

757
01:56:06,569 --> 01:56:11,360
In Buddhism we speak of store consciousness. 

758
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:25,489
And that is something much bigger than our thinking mind. 

759
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:29,930
Imagine an iceberg in the ocean. 

760
01:56:29,979 --> 01:56:34,145
The part that we see above the water is very small. 

761
01:56:34,194 --> 01:56:39,069
But the part in the water is huge. 

762
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:42,100
Store consciousness is like that. 

763
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:45,125
Our mind consciousness is very small.


764
01:56:45,174 --> 01:56:49,630
In neuroscience people like to speak of 

765
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:53,600
that part of consciousness as background consciousness.

766
01:56:54,899 --> 01:57:03,619
Sometimes we call it root consciousness, mūla-vijñāna.

767
01:57:06,199 --> 01:57:11,229
Sometimes we call it appropriating consciousness.

768
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:14,940
Sometimes we call it store consciousness.

769
01:57:14,989 --> 01:57:19,155
That part of consciousness is always with the body. 

770
01:57:19,204 --> 01:57:27,750
It has the capacity to retrieve information. 

771
01:57:28,119 --> 01:57:32,250
It has the capacity to process information. 

772
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:39,229
And it has the capacity to preserve, 

773
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:44,039
to conserve information. 

774
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:55,949
And mind consciousness is the upper level of consciousness. 

775
01:57:56,899 --> 01:58:02,114
Mind consciousness sometimes can stop operating, 

776
01:58:02,164 --> 01:58:04,539
like in the case: 

777
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:10,235
you sleep without dream. 

778
01:58:10,284 --> 01:58:13,905
Your mind consciousness stops completely, 

779
01:58:13,954 --> 01:58:17,735
if you do not have dream in your sleep. 

780
01:58:17,784 --> 01:58:21,875
There is a kind of meditation concentration 

781
01:58:21,925 --> 01:58:27,864
called Nopess[?] perception meditation. 

782
01:58:27,914 --> 01:58:30,289
And when the practitioner goes into that 

783
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:35,539
meditation his mind consciousness stops operating also. 

784
01:58:36,219 --> 01:58:40,145
And we talk about realm of life 

785
01:58:40,194 --> 01:58:42,664
where there is no mind consciousness, 

786
01:58:42,715 --> 01:58:45,350
there is only store consciousness.

787
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:49,024
Suppose we look at a tree. 

788
01:58:49,074 --> 01:58:54,444
We know that somehow there is consciousness in the tree, 

789
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:58,625
because the tree knows how to gather information, 

790
01:58:58,675 --> 01:59:02,625
to process information, to get the nourishment, 

791
01:59:02,675 --> 01:59:06,655
to react, to survive. 

792
01:59:06,704 --> 01:59:08,694
Consciousness is in a tree. 

793
01:59:08,744 --> 01:59:12,979
But the tree does not seem to have, 

794
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:17,444
doing a lot of thinking. 

795
01:59:17,494 --> 01:59:20,664
There is a Vietnamese poet who says that: 

796
01:59:20,715 --> 01:59:23,444
Well, next life, I would like to be a pine tree. 

797
01:59:23,494 --> 01:59:26,375
So that I don't have to think. 

798
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:30,180
To think makes me suffer too much.

799
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:42,059
In the Zen tradition mind consciousness is the gardener, 

800
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:49,750
and store consciousness is the land, it is the garden. 

801
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:56,085
The gardener can prepare the land, 

802
01:59:56,135 --> 02:00:01,979
plant the seed, water the seed. 

803
02:00:02,029 --> 02:00:06,229
But it is store consciousness, it is the land, 

804
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:13,219
that can produce the flower and the fruit of enlightenment. 

805
02:00:13,659 --> 02:00:17,800
So practising meditation we don't count 

806
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:20,375
on mind consciousness alone, 

807
02:00:20,424 --> 02:00:24,680
we count mostly on store consciousness. 

808
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:36,104
Mind consciousness has to play the role of the gardener. 

809
02:00:36,155 --> 02:00:42,510
It has to work the land, and plant the seed well, 

810
02:00:42,559 --> 02:00:45,864
and cover up, and water. 

811
02:00:45,914 --> 02:00:47,600
That is all. 

812
02:00:47,649 --> 02:00:53,215
The insight, the discovery, what we find out, 

813
02:00:53,264 --> 02:00:55,569
is not the work of mind consciousness, 

814
02:00:55,619 --> 02:01:00,350
it is the work of store. 

815
02:01:00,889 --> 02:01:07,155
And many scientific discoveries have been done in that: 

816
02:01:07,204 --> 02:01:11,954
not by the thinking, the thinking mind, 

817
02:01:12,005 --> 02:01:17,500
but by the unconscious, unconscious mind.

818
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:22,770
So it is possible for us 

819
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:31,350
to entrust the task to our deeper consciousness. 

820
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:38,114
We have to pose the question to ask the question correctly. 

821
02:01:38,164 --> 02:01:43,139
In Zen Buddhism we call that Koan. 

822
02:01:46,739 --> 02:01:51,389
Suppose the teacher gives you the Koan: 

823
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,949
Everything comes home to the one. 

824
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:05,085
Where the one will go, have to go?

825
02:02:05,135 --> 02:02:07,649
Or: 

826
02:02:09,739 --> 02:02:15,309
What is the sound of one hand?

827
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:22,039
All these are devices. 

828
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:27,270
This kind of question that we entrust to 

829
02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:29,300
store consciousness. 

830
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:33,770
The important thing is to 

831
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:39,710
ask the right question very clearly, 

832
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:46,539
and to entrust the question to store consciousness. 

833
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:50,309
And after having done that, 

834
02:02:50,359 --> 02:02:58,389
the gardener may like to do other things.

835
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:09,479
There is a Buddhist scholar in America. 

836
02:03:09,559 --> 02:03:16,770
One time I told him that I enjoy gardening. 

837
02:03:16,819 --> 02:03:25,295
I enjoy planting letters and things like that. 

838
02:03:25,344 --> 02:03:30,385
And I say that, when the letters does not grow well, 

839
02:03:30,434 --> 02:03:34,770
you don't blame the letters, 

840
02:03:34,819 --> 02:03:41,284
but you feel that if the letters grow well or not well, 

841
02:03:41,335 --> 02:03:44,174
it is the gardener who is responsible. 

842
02:03:44,225 --> 02:03:45,335
And he said: 

843
02:03:45,385 --> 02:03:48,979
Thay, you should not spend your time growing letters, 

844
02:03:49,029 --> 02:03:54,000
because you can use your time to write poems.

845
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:56,780
Because he liked my poetry. 

846
02:03:57,899 --> 02:03:59,764
I told him: 

847
02:03:59,815 --> 02:04:02,994
Dear friend, if I do not grow letters, 

848
02:04:03,045 --> 02:04:05,575
I can not write these poems. 

849
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:10,755
It is because I am capable of growing letters, 

850
02:04:10,805 --> 02:04:14,430
that is why I can produce a poem like that.

851
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:24,789
So washing your dishes, enjoying washing the dishes, 

852
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,305
stop the thinking, 

853
02:04:26,354 --> 02:04:29,289
and get the pleasure in washing the dishes, 

854
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:33,559
is a way to support store consciousness 

855
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:35,800
to bring about insight. 

856
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:41,845
Brushing your teeth mindfully, 

857
02:04:41,895 --> 02:04:44,149
and enjoy brushing your teeth, 

858
02:04:44,199 --> 02:04:49,380
do not think about your project, 

859
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:54,514
do not try to find the solution with your thinking mind. 

860
02:04:54,565 --> 02:04:57,520
And that is the practise. 

861
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:05,295
Non-thinking is the secret of the success. 

862
02:05:05,344 --> 02:05:11,074
And that is why the time, when we are not working, 

863
02:05:11,125 --> 02:05:13,710
that time can be very productive, 

864
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,909
if we know how to focus on the moment, 

865
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:21,914
and enjoy every moment of our daily live. 

866
02:05:21,965 --> 02:05:24,270
And if we know how to do that, 

867
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,614
we will not be victims of stress, anxiety, 

868
02:05:27,664 --> 02:05:31,444
depression, and so on. 

869
02:05:31,494 --> 02:05:34,920
That is one aspect of the problem. 

870
02:05:34,969 --> 02:05:37,385
The other aspect of the problem is, 

871
02:05:37,434 --> 02:05:41,694
that the time called work time, 

872
02:05:41,744 --> 02:05:43,725
we can handle it in such a way, 

873
02:05:43,774 --> 02:05:47,770
that we can enjoy, that it can bring us pleasure. 

874
02:05:51,739 --> 02:05:56,925
There is a way not to be under pressure. 

875
02:05:56,975 --> 02:05:59,994
There is a way in order to enjoy really 

876
02:06:00,045 --> 02:06:03,079
what you are doing as work.

877
02:06:07,559 --> 02:06:12,425
We in Plum Village, we do a lot of things. 

878
02:06:12,475 --> 02:06:19,085
We want to succeed in what we do. 

879
02:06:19,135 --> 02:06:23,039
We offer many retreats of mindfulness everywhere, 

880
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:28,985
in many countries, Europe, Asia, America, Australia. 

881
02:06:29,034 --> 02:06:32,530
We organise days of mindfulness, 

882
02:06:32,579 --> 02:06:34,364
sessions of practise, 

883
02:06:34,414 --> 02:06:39,255
we organise retreats for health professionals, 

884
02:06:39,304 --> 02:06:43,670
school teachers, young people, and so on. 

885
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:47,949
We want to succeed in our work also. 

886
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:54,385
But we learned how to do the work in such a way, 

887
02:06:54,434 --> 02:07:02,090
that we will not be victims of pressure and stress. 

888
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:13,954
Many monks and nuns, who are excellent Dharma teachers, 

889
02:07:14,005 --> 02:07:18,680
they enjoy cooking, they enjoy cleaning, 

890
02:07:18,729 --> 02:07:21,095
they enjoy gardening, 

891
02:07:21,144 --> 02:07:23,760
and they consider these things as 

892
02:07:23,809 --> 02:07:28,300
important as the other kind of work. 

893
02:07:28,539 --> 02:07:32,310
We learned how to enjoy rearranging the 

894
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:35,279
cushions in the meditation hall. 

895
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:45,365
We enjoy growing vegetables, and everything we do, 

896
02:07:45,414 --> 02:07:47,694
we put all our heart and mind in it, 

897
02:07:47,744 --> 02:07:52,575
and we try to do it in such a way, 

898
02:07:52,625 --> 02:07:56,795
that freedom and joy and brotherhood and 

899
02:07:56,844 --> 02:07:59,340
sisterhood become possible.

900
02:08:01,609 --> 02:08:06,595
There are times when we sit together in a meeting, 

901
02:08:06,644 --> 02:08:12,024
but we don't talk about work. 

902
02:08:12,074 --> 02:08:16,739
We have a weekly meeting called meeting of happiness. 

903
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:24,034
And in the meeting you just remind each other, 

904
02:08:24,085 --> 02:08:28,180
that we have so many conditions of happiness available. 

905
02:08:28,659 --> 02:08:31,815
It may take 2 hours, 3 hours, 

906
02:08:31,864 --> 02:08:34,074
just with one cup of tea, 

907
02:08:34,125 --> 02:08:40,310
and we nourish each other with the practise of mindfulness. 

908
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:46,255
We remind each other, that we are very lucky people - 

909
02:08:46,305 --> 02:08:49,225
that we have so many conditions of happiness 

910
02:08:49,274 --> 02:08:51,595
available right in the here and the now, 

911
02:08:51,644 --> 02:08:55,865
we don't need to go and look for more 

912
02:08:55,914 --> 02:08:58,020
conditions of happiness. 

913
02:08:58,310 --> 02:09:00,899
And that is every nourishing. 

914
02:09:00,949 --> 02:09:06,739
And I think that in a corporation, this is possible also. 

915
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:17,505
And many of the practise in the practise centre can be used 

916
02:09:17,554 --> 02:09:21,920
in the life of a corporation.

917
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:35,895
Every time we organise a retreat, 6 days or 7 

918
02:09:35,944 --> 02:09:45,189
days, we see many people transform. 

919
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:52,574
The practise is simple enough for everyone to do. 

920
02:09:52,625 --> 02:09:55,485
The practise of mindful breathing, 

921
02:09:55,534 --> 02:09:57,614
mindful sitting and walking, 

922
02:09:57,664 --> 02:10:05,210
releasing the tension in the body, everyone can do. 

923
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:10,880
And when you are able to reduce the tension in your body, 

924
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:13,725
to release the tension in your body, 

925
02:10:13,774 --> 02:10:17,529
you also can reduce the amount of pain in your body, 

926
02:10:17,579 --> 02:10:20,109
including necrotic pain. 

927
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,494
Because the pain and tension they go together. 

928
02:10:23,545 --> 02:10:28,725
If you can release tension, you can reduce the pain. 

929
02:10:28,774 --> 02:10:31,905
And the basic practise of mindful breathing, 

930
02:10:31,954 --> 02:10:34,795
to be aware of your body, 

931
02:10:34,844 --> 02:10:37,145
and to release the tension in your body, 

932
02:10:37,194 --> 02:10:42,380
you can do it several times a day. 

933
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:46,125
Many of our brothers and sisters have programmed a 

934
02:10:46,174 --> 02:10:48,829
bell of mindfulness in the computer. 

935
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:55,260
And every 15 minutes, the bell reminds us to stop, and to 

936
02:10:55,689 --> 02:10:59,939
enjoy breathing in and breathing out - 

937
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:04,029
the bell of mindfulness.

938
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:33,310
[Gong]

939
02:11:33,359 --> 02:11:39,829
The practise helps us to touch 

940
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:44,395
the conditions of happiness in the here and now, 

941
02:11:44,444 --> 02:11:48,684
so that we can generate a feeling of joy 

942
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:51,439
at any moment we want. 

943
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:55,550
And that is not too difficult. 

944
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:58,880
If you go back to your body, 

945
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:03,619
if you bring your mind home to your body, 

946
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:07,284
and establish yourself in the here and the now, 

947
02:12:07,335 --> 02:12:11,230
your will realise that conditions for 

948
02:12:11,279 --> 02:12:13,635
your happiness are more then enough, 

949
02:12:13,684 --> 02:12:17,404
and happiness is possible right in the here and the now. 

950
02:12:17,454 --> 02:12:22,199
So to generate a moment of joy is possible, 

951
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,195
to generate a moment of happiness is also 

952
02:12:25,244 --> 02:12:31,569
possible for a practitioner, no matter where and when.

953
02:12:31,909 --> 02:12:38,215
And the practise of mindfulness also helps us to recognise a painful feeling, 

954
02:12:38,264 --> 02:12:42,600
a painful emotion, when they manifest. 

955
02:12:45,699 --> 02:12:52,045
A painful feeling, we try, 

956
02:12:52,095 --> 02:12:56,300
we have the tendency to try to run away from it. 

957
02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:00,409
We want to cover it up by consumption. 

958
02:13:01,029 --> 02:13:07,195
If we listen to music, if we read magazines, 

959
02:13:07,244 --> 02:13:10,060
if we eat, 

960
02:13:11,069 --> 02:13:18,125
maybe it is not because these things bring 

961
02:13:18,174 --> 02:13:19,565
us a lot of happiness, 

962
02:13:19,614 --> 02:13:22,560
but because we don't want to get in touch 

963
02:13:22,609 --> 02:13:23,635
with the suffering. 

964
02:13:23,685 --> 02:13:29,275
We want to cover it up with consumption. 

965
02:13:29,324 --> 02:13:33,234
Obesity is the outcome of that. 

966
02:13:33,284 --> 02:13:38,369
You have the feeling of loneliness, 

967
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:43,760
despair, anger, worries in you, 

968
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:46,774
and you do not know how to handle, 

969
02:13:46,824 --> 02:13:50,475
and that is why you want to forget, to run away. 

970
02:13:50,524 --> 02:13:54,564
And one of the ways is to just to consume. 

971
02:13:54,614 --> 02:13:58,720
So music, magazines, food, 

972
02:13:58,770 --> 02:14:02,500
are there in order to help you to cover up your suffering. 

973
02:14:02,549 --> 02:14:05,159
You do not solve the problem.

974
02:14:05,819 --> 02:14:09,755
But the practise consists in going home, 

975
02:14:09,804 --> 02:14:12,640
and take good care of that pain: 

976
02:14:12,770 --> 02:14:18,435
Breathing in, I am aware of the painful feeling in me.

977
02:14:18,484 --> 02:14:21,660
There is the energy of pain of course. 

978
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:24,525
But as a practitioner you generate the 

979
02:14:24,574 --> 02:14:27,029
energy of mindfulness and concentration, 

980
02:14:27,079 --> 02:14:31,609
and with the second energy you recognise the first energy. 

981
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:34,310
Hello there my little pain. 

982
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:37,070
I know you are there. 

983
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:39,185
I will take good care of you.

984
02:14:39,234 --> 02:14:45,190
So like a mother, holding her baby, 

985
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:47,265
when the body suffers, 

986
02:14:47,314 --> 02:14:51,730
the practitioner generates the energy of mindfulness and concentration, 

987
02:14:51,779 --> 02:14:55,364
and go home, and take care of the painful feeling, 

988
02:14:55,414 --> 02:15:01,239
or the painful emotion in him or in her, and get a relief.

989
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:04,675
So many young people, 

990
02:15:04,724 --> 02:15:08,430
who are not capable of handling a strong emotion. 

991
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,110
And they believe that the only way 

992
02:15:13,159 --> 02:15:16,904
to stop suffering is go and kill themselves. 

993
02:15:16,954 --> 02:15:21,055
That is why so many young people commit suicide everywhere. 

994
02:15:21,104 --> 02:15:24,659
But we know very well that an emotion, 

995
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:30,995
whether it is strong, however strong it is, 

996
02:15:31,045 --> 02:15:32,680
it is only an emotion. 

997
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:36,529
And we are much more that an emotion. 

998
02:15:36,579 --> 02:15:38,475
We don't have to. 

999
02:15:38,524 --> 02:15:41,960
An emotion that is something, that comes, 

1000
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:45,715
and stays for some time, and finally will have to go away. 

1001
02:15:45,764 --> 02:15:50,355
Why do we have to die, because of just one emotion? 

1002
02:15:50,404 --> 02:15:53,899
That is what you can remind yourself, 

1003
02:15:53,949 --> 02:15:58,300
when an emotion manifests in you. 

1004
02:15:59,170 --> 02:16:05,050
And if you know the practise of mindful breathing, 

1005
02:16:05,099 --> 02:16:09,289
mindful walking, generating the energy of mindfulness, 

1006
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:15,100
you can every well recognise and embrace that emotion, 

1007
02:16:15,149 --> 02:16:17,480
and you are save. 

1008
02:16:17,529 --> 02:16:21,659
An emotion is like a storm coming. 

1009
02:16:21,710 --> 02:16:25,220
And there are ways in order to stand, 

1010
02:16:25,649 --> 02:16:30,340
and not to allow the storm to blow you away.

1011
02:16:30,389 --> 02:16:33,709
The practise of deep breathing, 

1012
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:38,244
in a position of sitting or laying down: 

1013
02:16:38,295 --> 02:16:43,920
focus your attention on the rise and fall of your abdomen. 

1014
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:47,465
And just that, stop all the thinking. 

1015
02:16:47,514 --> 02:16:49,020
Because the more you think, 

1016
02:16:49,069 --> 02:16:52,880
the stronger the emotion can become. 

1017
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:55,950
Stopping the thinking. 

1018
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:03,380
Bring your mind down to the level of the navel, 

1019
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:06,159
and breath in deeply, 

1020
02:17:06,209 --> 02:17:10,755
and become aware of the rise and fall of your abdomen, 

1021
02:17:10,805 --> 02:17:14,055
and stay in that position, and continue, 

1022
02:17:14,104 --> 02:17:19,739
and your emotion could not do anything to you. 

1023
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:24,014
And after 5 minutes, 10 minutes or even half an hour, 

1024
02:17:24,064 --> 02:17:27,744
the emotion will go, and you will survive it. 

1025
02:17:27,795 --> 02:17:33,720
And next time, when it comes, you will do just that. 

1026
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:36,244
It is easy enough. 

1027
02:17:36,295 --> 02:17:41,795
We should train ourselves only a few times every day. 

1028
02:17:41,844 --> 02:17:45,915
If we know how to do it for a few minutes, 

1029
02:17:45,965 --> 02:17:51,149
and then after a few weeks it will become a habit. 

1030
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:54,375
And when the emotion manifests you will 

1031
02:17:54,424 --> 02:17:56,485
remember to practise. 

1032
02:17:56,534 --> 02:18:00,369
And you are no longer afraid of an emotion.

1033
02:18:00,930 --> 02:18:06,845
So when the baby suffers, the mother should be there, 

1034
02:18:06,895 --> 02:18:11,369
in order to pick up the baby, and hold the baby tenderly. 

1035
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:15,615
The mother does not know what is the cause of the 

1036
02:18:15,665 --> 02:18:16,950
suffering of the baby, 

1037
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,174
but the fact that she is holding the baby tenderly, 

1038
02:18:20,224 --> 02:18:23,795
can already make the baby suffer less. 

1039
02:18:23,845 --> 02:18:26,784
Because the energy of tenderness begins 

1040
02:18:26,834 --> 02:18:32,295
to penetrate into the baby, that brings a relief. 

1041
02:18:32,345 --> 02:18:37,610
And after having held the child for a few minutes, 

1042
02:18:37,659 --> 02:18:41,569
the mother may find out what is wrong with the baby, 

1043
02:18:41,619 --> 02:18:45,079
and she can change the situation easily. 

1044
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:47,725
The same is true with a practitioner. 

1045
02:18:47,774 --> 02:18:48,704
In the beginning, 

1046
02:18:48,754 --> 02:18:53,834
she does not know what is the root of that pain, 

1047
02:18:53,884 --> 02:18:55,790
that emotion. 

1048
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:00,790
But the fact that she is able to hold it tenderly, 

1049
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:12,555
without an attempt to run away, can already bring a relief. 

1050
02:19:12,604 --> 02:19:18,095
And with a little more of concentration and mindfulness, 

1051
02:19:18,145 --> 02:19:20,090
we can discover the nature, 

1052
02:19:20,139 --> 02:19:22,430
the roots of our emotion, 

1053
02:19:22,479 --> 02:19:31,295
and that will help transform the emotion and the pain.

1054
02:19:31,345 --> 02:19:36,045
And if adult, father, mother, 

1055
02:19:36,094 --> 02:19:38,424
school teachers know how to do that, 

1056
02:19:38,474 --> 02:19:42,450
they will teach the young people how to do it. 

1057
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:46,315
It is easy enough to learn. 

1058
02:19:46,364 --> 02:19:52,260
And therefore, a practitioner of mindfulness is capable of:


1059
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:54,965
releasing the tension in her body,

1060
02:19:55,014 --> 02:19:58,295
reduce the pain in his body,

1061
02:19:58,344 --> 02:20:03,494
generate a feeling of joy whenever he wants,

1062
02:20:03,545 --> 02:20:07,904
generate a feeling of happiness whenever she wants,

1063
02:20:07,954 --> 02:20:12,235
recognise and embrace a painful feeling,

1064
02:20:12,284 --> 02:20:16,970
recognise and embrace a painful emotion.

1065
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:21,299
All these things can be learned.  

1066
02:20:21,349 --> 02:20:24,220
And we hope that in the future, 

1067
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:27,584
these kinds of practises can be taught in 

1068
02:20:27,634 --> 02:20:29,590
school at every level. 

1069
02:20:29,639 --> 02:20:32,360
We are trying to do that. 

1070
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:37,619
We have met with school teachers in many counties, 

1071
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:43,715
and they all agree, that this is something they must learn, 

1072
02:20:43,764 --> 02:20:48,649
and bring into the classroom, and help the young people.

1073
02:21:05,569 --> 02:21:29,299
[Gong]

1074
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:34,814
The miracle of transformation and healing 

1075
02:21:34,864 --> 02:21:39,630
always happen in our retreats. 

1076
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:47,834
During this North American tour, 

1077
02:21:47,884 --> 02:21:52,795
we have offered a retreat in Vancouver for 800 people, 

1078
02:21:52,845 --> 02:22:00,055
after that another retreat for more than 900 in Colorado, 

1079
02:22:00,104 --> 02:22:03,700
and we just finished one in Southern California, 

1080
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:09,239
Escondido for 700 people. 

1081
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:14,415
And the miracle of transformation and healing 

1082
02:22:14,465 --> 02:22:15,979
always happened. 

1083
02:22:16,029 --> 02:22:22,204
And using the practise of compassionate listening 

1084
02:22:22,255 --> 02:22:26,774
and gentle speech, many people are able, 

1085
02:22:26,825 --> 02:22:36,260
are capable of restoring communication and reconcile. 

1086
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:38,729
And there are those of us, 

1087
02:22:38,779 --> 02:22:42,040
who can use our mobile phone 

1088
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:45,985
to practise listening with compassion, 

1089
02:22:46,034 --> 02:22:48,959
and using loving speech in order to 

1090
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:51,444
reconcile with those who are at home, 

1091
02:22:51,494 --> 02:22:53,610
who are not in the retreat. 

1092
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:57,645
And we have been offering so many retreats 

1093
02:22:57,694 --> 02:23:02,579
like that in the world, and seen that the effect, 

1094
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,315
the result, the foot of the practise, 

1095
02:23:07,364 --> 02:23:09,825
we are encouraged in this practise. 

1096
02:23:09,875 --> 02:23:13,950
That is why as monks and nuns and lay practitioners, 

1097
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,385
we are going to continue, 

1098
02:23:16,434 --> 02:23:21,180
because that brings us a lot of happiness.

1099
02:23:21,229 --> 02:23:23,805
And we want to share the practise, 

1100
02:23:23,854 --> 02:23:26,420
and to help many people to suffer less. 

1101
02:23:26,470 --> 02:23:32,619
And that is why we want also success. 

1102
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:39,060
But our success, our willingness to succeed, 

1103
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:48,029
does not remove us from the present moment. 

1104
02:23:48,630 --> 02:23:51,875
Our practise is to, 

1105
02:23:51,924 --> 02:23:56,959
is to be grounded always in the present moment. 

1106
02:23:57,010 --> 02:24:05,145
We know that the future is made only of one element: 

1107
02:24:05,194 --> 02:24:07,575
that is the present moment. 

1108
02:24:07,625 --> 02:24:14,190
And if we take of the present moment the best way we can, 

1109
02:24:14,239 --> 02:24:16,735
it means that we have done everything we 

1110
02:24:16,784 --> 02:24:18,989
can do for the future. 

1111
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:22,430
And that is our practise: 

1112
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:24,729
to be there in the here and the now, 

1113
02:24:24,779 --> 02:24:26,810
and do our best with that, 

1114
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:37,770
and do not let the worries, the projects, carry us away.

1115
02:24:39,369 --> 02:24:48,959
I think many are successful in their career, 

1116
02:24:49,869 --> 02:24:55,090
but many have become victims of their own success. 

1117
02:24:56,680 --> 02:24:58,604
They are not happy. 

1118
02:24:58,654 --> 02:25:14,200
Happiness is not the aim. 

1119
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:21,310
When we do something, we want to succeed. 

1120
02:25:22,329 --> 02:25:29,270
But is it worthwhile to continue, 

1121
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:35,399
if that success does not bring happiness? 

1122
02:25:40,959 --> 02:25:46,329
And many have become victims of their own success. 

1123
02:25:47,139 --> 02:25:53,024
And although they succeed in their enterprise, 

1124
02:25:53,075 --> 02:25:58,055
but happiness is not there. 

1125
02:25:58,104 --> 02:26:06,220
They have no time to love, to live their life. 

1126
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:09,750
They have no time for themselves, 

1127
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:13,010
they have no time for their beloved one.

1128
02:26:13,689 --> 02:26:18,850
I know a successful businessman in Germany. 

1129
02:26:18,899 --> 02:26:21,725
His name is Frederick. 

1130
02:26:21,774 --> 02:26:25,930
He is only 40. 

1131
02:26:26,619 --> 02:26:29,444
He is a very successful businessman. 

1132
02:26:29,494 --> 02:26:32,990
But his wife Laura suffers very deeply, 

1133
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,799
because of loneliness, 

1134
02:26:34,850 --> 02:26:37,614
because Frederick did not have the time, 

1135
02:26:37,665 --> 02:26:45,329
even for himself, and for her, and for their son. 

1136
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:55,815
She tried to suffer less by doing human talent work. 

1137
02:26:55,864 --> 02:26:59,130
She tried to forget her loneliness by 

1138
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:05,235
going to school and get another degree. 

1139
02:27:05,284 --> 02:27:07,239
But that did not help. 

1140
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:10,755
And she cried during the night. 

1141
02:27:10,805 --> 02:27:12,295
And he said that: 

1142
02:27:12,344 --> 02:27:18,750
Darling, no-one can replace me now. 

1143
02:27:20,729 --> 02:27:24,014
I have to wait 3, 4 years, 

1144
02:27:24,064 --> 02:27:27,084
before I can find someone to replace me, 

1145
02:27:27,135 --> 02:27:29,345
and then we will have more time for 

1146
02:27:29,395 --> 02:27:32,819
ourselves and for our son. 

1147
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,549
For the moment, no-one can replace me.

1148
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:44,075
And that promise was never been fulfilled, 

1149
02:27:44,125 --> 02:27:50,614
because 6 months later he got killed in an accident, 

1150
02:27:50,665 --> 02:27:52,840
car accident. 

1151
02:27:55,510 --> 02:28:01,174
He was so busy, that when his wife was hospitalised, 

1152
02:28:01,225 --> 02:28:04,940
he could not have the time to go to the hospital. 

1153
02:28:04,989 --> 02:28:11,079
And even when his son Phillip was hospitalised, 

1154
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:16,154
he could not go to the hospital, 

1155
02:28:16,204 --> 02:28:18,895
because his time, 

1156
02:28:18,944 --> 02:28:24,479
his energy is sucked by the will to succeed. 

1157
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:27,340
And you know what happened: 

1158
02:28:27,389 --> 02:28:29,979
only 3 days after his death, 

1159
02:28:30,029 --> 02:28:33,579
they found someone to replace him. 

1160
02:28:37,270 --> 02:28:44,159
And Frederick is still alive. 

1161
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:51,514
There are many Frederick among us. 

1162
02:28:51,564 --> 02:28:54,954
And many Laura are among us. 

1163
02:28:55,005 --> 02:28:58,170
We have to wake up from that. 

1164
02:28:58,229 --> 02:29:02,380
We have to learn how to 

1165
02:29:03,639 --> 02:29:10,670
change our way of life in order to be, to be truly alive. 

1166
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:19,395
And the practise of mindfulness helps us bring real love, 

1167
02:29:19,444 --> 02:29:24,079
real happiness to our life.

1168
02:29:24,130 --> 02:29:29,924
There are 4 elements of true love (Brahmavihāras), 

1169
02:29:29,975 --> 02:29:35,840
that mindfulness can help generate:


1170
02:29:35,889 --> 02:29:42,439
The 1. element of true love is loving kindness, Maitrī. 

1171
02:29:42,489 --> 02:29:48,159
That is the capacity to make another person happy. 

1172
02:29:49,489 --> 02:29:53,350
And we have already learned that, 

1173
02:29:53,399 --> 02:29:56,740
if we cannot make ourselves peaceful, 

1174
02:29:56,790 --> 02:30:01,600
fresh, and happy, we cannot make another person happy. 

1175
02:30:01,649 --> 02:30:06,920
The practise of mindfulness helps restore solidity, 

1176
02:30:06,970 --> 02:30:11,119
freedom, piece, and freshness to us, 

1177
02:30:11,170 --> 02:30:13,299
so that we can, 

1178
02:30:13,349 --> 02:30:17,799
we have the capacity to make the other person happy.

1179
02:30:17,849 --> 02:30:25,630
The 2. element of true love is compassion, Karuṇā. 

1180
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:30,190
That capacity of understanding the suffering 

1181
02:30:30,239 --> 02:30:32,779
and help remove it. 

1182
02:30:32,829 --> 02:30:34,665
If you love someone, 

1183
02:30:34,715 --> 02:30:38,274
you should understand the suffering in him or in her, 

1184
02:30:38,325 --> 02:30:43,750
and you should be able to help transform that, remove that. 

1185
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:48,690
And that you can do only after you have done it for you. 

1186
02:30:48,739 --> 02:30:52,049
You have fear, anger, despair in you, 

1187
02:30:52,099 --> 02:30:55,185
and if you do not know how to transform it, 

1188
02:30:55,235 --> 02:30:58,415
how can you help your beloved one to do the same? 

1189
02:30:58,465 --> 02:31:02,145
So understanding the suffering inside, 

1190
02:31:02,194 --> 02:31:05,479
and bring a relief and transformation, 

1191
02:31:05,529 --> 02:31:07,529
is very crucial for love. 

1192
02:31:07,579 --> 02:31:12,149
And then you will be able to help your beloved one 

1193
02:31:12,439 --> 02:31:16,560
transform the suffering. 

1194
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:21,180
So that is the 2. element of true love: 

1195
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:28,369
the capacity to help someone suffer less.

1196
02:31:30,149 --> 02:31:34,994
And the 3. element of true love is joy (Muditā), 

1197
02:31:35,045 --> 02:31:40,420
because true love always generate joy for you 

1198
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:42,549
and for the other person. 

1199
02:31:42,599 --> 02:31:48,619
If both of us cry during the process of loving, 

1200
02:31:48,670 --> 02:31:50,225
that is not true love. 

1201
02:31:50,274 --> 02:31:55,900
True love should bring joy every moment of our daily life. 

1202
02:31:55,950 --> 02:32:03,110
And mindfulness can help doing that.

1203
02:32:03,439 --> 02:32:11,315
And the 4. element of true love is inclusiveness (Upekṣā). 

1204
02:32:11,364 --> 02:32:13,189
In true love, 

1205
02:32:13,239 --> 02:32:15,645
there is no longer any frontier between 

1206
02:32:15,694 --> 02:32:17,665
you and your beloved one. 

1207
02:32:17,715 --> 02:32:20,829
Your suffering is his suffering. 

1208
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:25,079
His happiness is your happiness. 

1209
02:32:25,889 --> 02:32:30,454
And there is a perfect way of understanding 

1210
02:32:30,505 --> 02:32:32,529
between the two of you. 

1211
02:32:32,579 --> 02:32:37,405
And together you can serve and help many people. 

1212
02:32:37,454 --> 02:32:42,600
True love is the kind of love that always grows. 

1213
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:46,465
It has no frontier. 

1214
02:32:46,514 --> 02:32:49,545
And practising true love, 

1215
02:32:49,594 --> 02:32:57,690
you begin to embrace everyone, the whole planet, 

1216
02:32:57,739 --> 02:33:00,889
and bring a lot of joy to you.

1217
02:33:00,939 --> 02:33:06,189
And that is why we have to know where we go. 

1218
02:33:07,090 --> 02:33:10,245
If love is our destination, 

1219
02:33:10,295 --> 02:33:13,485
and then we have to sacrifice other things, 

1220
02:33:13,534 --> 02:33:15,584
that are not love, like: 


1221
02:33:15,635 --> 02:33:17,145
fame,

1222
02:33:17,194 --> 02:33:18,760
wealth,

1223
02:33:18,809 --> 02:33:21,060
sensual pleasure,

1224
02:33:21,869 --> 02:33:24,075
power.

1225
02:33:24,125 --> 02:33:26,084
Because there are those, 

1226
02:33:26,134 --> 02:33:31,420
who have plenty of these things, and who suffer very deeply.

1227
02:33:34,829 --> 02:33:45,040
And when I was ordained as a monk at the age of 16, 

1228
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:49,674
my teacher gave me the Dharma name: 

1229
02:33:49,725 --> 02:33:51,854
Nhất Hạnh, which means: 

1230
02:33:51,904 --> 02:33:55,750
one action - you do only one thing. 

1231
02:33:55,799 --> 02:34:03,420
You don't do many things at the same time - mono-tasking. 

1232
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:15,560
And I tried to live according to this teaching. 

1233
02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:19,834
I want to transform myself. 

1234
02:34:19,885 --> 02:34:23,045
I want to help people be happy. 

1235
02:34:23,094 --> 02:34:26,130
Because I know that, if people are happy, 

1236
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:28,529
I can be happy also. 

1237
02:34:29,369 --> 02:34:41,670
And that is why Buddhist meditation is made of 2 elements: 

1238
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:47,079
the 1. element is concentration. 

1239
02:34:49,189 --> 02:34:54,619
You focus your attention just on one thing. 

1240
02:34:56,329 --> 02:35:00,095
Otherwise your concentration is not 

1241
02:35:00,145 --> 02:35:06,680
powerful enough to get a breakthrough, and get a insight. 

1242
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:11,010
And concentration can be practised, 

1243
02:35:11,059 --> 02:35:15,489
not by thinking, but by:


1244
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:17,750
brushing your teeth in mindfulness,

1245
02:35:17,799 --> 02:35:20,639
washing your dishes in mindfulness,

1246
02:35:20,689 --> 02:35:26,505
watering the vegetables in mindfulness,

1247
02:35:26,555 --> 02:35:28,104
enjoying every step.

1248
02:35:28,154 --> 02:35:32,400
That will make the concentration more and more powerful, 

1249
02:35:32,450 --> 02:35:34,905
and your store consciousness will bring, 

1250
02:35:34,954 --> 02:35:38,720
will offer the insight, that you need. 

1251
02:35:39,159 --> 02:35:45,655
And that is why the 1. element of Buddhist 

1252
02:35:45,704 --> 02:35:49,139
meditation is Samādhi concentration, 

1253
02:35:49,189 --> 02:35:54,079
and the 2. is Vipassanā. 

1254
02:35:54,130 --> 02:35:58,670
It means looking deeply. 

1255
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:01,625
You concentrate on just one thing. 

1256
02:36:01,674 --> 02:36:04,875
And you only look deeply into that one thing. 

1257
02:36:04,924 --> 02:36:10,850
And that is the technique, is secret of bringing up insight.

1258
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:17,375
I think concerning information, we know that, 

1259
02:36:17,424 --> 02:36:18,665
we have the feeling, 

1260
02:36:18,715 --> 02:36:22,690
that we are overwhelmed by information. 

1261
02:36:22,739 --> 02:36:25,180
We don't need that much information. 

1262
02:36:25,229 --> 02:36:27,779
We just need a few. 

1263
02:36:27,979 --> 02:36:30,545
And there are basic information, 

1264
02:36:30,595 --> 02:36:37,415
that we should maintain alive. 

1265
02:36:37,465 --> 02:36:39,495
Because there are many things we know, 

1266
02:36:39,545 --> 02:36:42,500
but we never but into practise. 

1267
02:36:42,829 --> 02:36:46,034
So your happiness does not depend on how 

1268
02:36:46,084 --> 02:36:49,174
much information you have, but how, 

1269
02:36:49,224 --> 02:36:52,020
what kind of information, that you have, 

1270
02:36:52,069 --> 02:36:57,899
and how you put into practise that kind of information. 

1271
02:36:59,489 --> 02:37:02,325
And basic information is: 

1272
02:37:02,375 --> 02:37:06,779
that we are alive. 

1273
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:11,489
Breathing in, I know I am alive. 

1274
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:14,989
And breathing out, 

1275
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:18,665
I can touch all wonders of life in me and 

1276
02:37:18,715 --> 02:37:20,704
around me in this moment.

1277
02:37:20,755 --> 02:37:24,299
And that can cultivate my happiness, 

1278
02:37:24,350 --> 02:37:27,440
that can make me an instrument of love, 

1279
02:37:27,489 --> 02:37:30,979
and I can help, I can love.

1280
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:36,235
So let us have the rest of our time for a few questions. 

1281
02:37:36,284 --> 02:37:37,779
Thank you.

1282
02:37:37,829 --> 02:37:47,489
[Applause]

1283
02:37:51,489 --> 02:38:22,439
[Gong]

1284
02:38:33,739 --> 02:38:47,760
[Organisational]

1285
02:38:47,809 --> 02:38:49,000
Hi. 

1286
02:38:49,049 --> 02:38:50,459
Oh, it works. 

1287
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:54,614
Thank you for being fully present here for us. 

1288
02:38:54,665 --> 02:38:58,795
I have a question about mindful walking. 

1289
02:38:58,845 --> 02:39:02,319
I am pregnant, so when I am walking, 

1290
02:39:02,369 --> 02:39:06,500
my hip really hurts, and my knees, they all hurt. 

1291
02:39:06,549 --> 02:39:08,860
So if I do mindful walking, 

1292
02:39:08,909 --> 02:39:12,595
does that means I focus on my painful knees, 

1293
02:39:12,645 --> 02:39:13,965
and my painful hips, 

1294
02:39:14,014 --> 02:39:17,045
and shouldn't I just think about something 

1295
02:39:17,094 --> 02:39:20,020
else and get distracted?

1296
02:39:22,860 --> 02:39:26,985
You may join us sitting on a chair, 

1297
02:39:27,034 --> 02:39:28,284
and someone can push you, 

1298
02:39:28,334 --> 02:39:33,295
and you can profit from the collective 

1299
02:39:33,344 --> 02:39:35,729
energy of peace and joy. 

1300
02:39:35,779 --> 02:39:41,649
And you do walking meditation with your feet later, 

1301
02:39:41,700 --> 02:39:49,880
but now you can sit on a chair and have someone push you. 

1302
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:51,869
This is possible.

1303
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:56,700
So this is not the right time for me to do mindful walking?!

1304
02:39:57,860 --> 02:40:04,159
I think at least you can enjoy a few steps. 

1305
02:40:04,209 --> 02:40:06,665
You can always enjoy a few steps. 

1306
02:40:06,715 --> 02:40:11,209
But when it becomes difficult, tiring, you can stop.

1307
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:13,739
Thank you.

1308
02:40:13,790 --> 02:40:15,100
Yes.

1309
02:40:17,290 --> 02:40:23,505
There are practitioners of meditation who could not walk. 

1310
02:40:23,555 --> 02:40:27,139
But they like to join us during walking meditation. 

1311
02:40:27,190 --> 02:40:34,264
They bring along their wheelchair, 

1312
02:40:34,314 --> 02:40:37,889
and they enjoy the Sangha, 

1313
02:40:37,939 --> 02:40:42,299
and the collective energy generated by the practise.

1314
02:40:45,119 --> 02:40:47,240
Hello. 

1315
02:40:47,290 --> 02:40:49,939
This one works here. 

1316
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:56,010
So, my name is Alex Aris. 

1317
02:40:56,060 --> 02:40:58,600
I am working at Google. 

1318
02:40:58,649 --> 02:41:03,985
And so, my question is not necessarily my question, 

1319
02:41:04,034 --> 02:41:06,555
but it could be maybe a typical Googler. 

1320
02:41:06,604 --> 02:41:09,549
But I think this is very relevant. 

1321
02:41:09,599 --> 02:41:10,940
So you said: 

1322
02:41:10,989 --> 02:41:14,364
if you practise mindfulness, this is good, 

1323
02:41:14,415 --> 02:41:18,840
but I am thinking, how we can apply this in Google. 

1324
02:41:18,889 --> 02:41:23,020
So I think a typical Googler would think about, 

1325
02:41:23,069 --> 02:41:25,834
well, you know, if I practise mindfulness, 

1326
02:41:25,884 --> 02:41:28,250
then I think I am going to lose a lot of time. 

1327
02:41:28,299 --> 02:41:31,064
Because you mentioned, you know:


1328
02:41:31,114 --> 02:41:33,399
Do your breakfast with mindfulness, 

1329
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:35,799
so don't think about the projects.

1330
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:40,295
And get the chance to get in touch with your life.

1331
02:41:40,345 --> 02:41:42,060
Don't multitask.

1332
02:41:42,110 --> 02:41:44,470
Don't eat quickly.

1333
02:41:45,130 --> 02:41:47,639
Don't do a task while eating.

1334
02:41:47,689 --> 02:41:49,375
But there are many people, 

1335
02:41:49,424 --> 02:41:51,909
who use their laptops while eating. 

1336
02:41:51,959 --> 02:41:58,670
So and then, they would be concerned: 

1337
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:00,055
what am I gonna do, 

1338
02:42:00,104 --> 02:42:03,790
that I am gonna be losing a lot of this time. 

1339
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,645
And even if they are not concerned that 

1340
02:42:06,694 --> 02:42:07,865
they will be losing their time, 

1341
02:42:07,915 --> 02:42:09,935
they will be concerned that other people 

1342
02:42:09,985 --> 02:42:13,625
will think that they are spending too 

1343
02:42:13,674 --> 02:42:17,505
much time eating breakfast, or doing other things, 

1344
02:42:17,555 --> 02:42:19,245
and not thinking about their projects. 

1345
02:42:19,295 --> 02:42:19,604
And so: 

1346
02:42:19,654 --> 02:42:21,454
What will my team think about me? 

1347
02:42:21,504 --> 02:42:26,060
What will the performance review be about me? 

1348
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:30,799
So will they say he didn't spend enough time and so on. 

1349
02:42:30,850 --> 02:42:37,615
So how do you, you know, reply to these concerns, 

1350
02:42:37,665 --> 02:42:41,920
thinking if we would apply this in Google.

1351
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,529
I have said that: 

1352
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:56,354
usually our thinking may be not very productive. 

1353
02:42:56,404 --> 02:43:00,029
Our thinking is sometimes very productive, 

1354
02:43:00,079 --> 02:43:02,130
but not always productive. 

1355
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:06,909
And our thinking may lead us away. 

1356
02:43:08,869 --> 02:43:12,189
That is one thing I said. 

1357
02:43:12,239 --> 02:43:20,995
And thinking is not the only way to succeed in finding out, 

1358
02:43:21,045 --> 02:43:23,905
what you want to find out. 

1359
02:43:23,954 --> 02:43:26,465
The 2. thing I said is that: 

1360
02:43:26,514 --> 02:43:28,764
while you are brushing your teeth mindfully, 

1361
02:43:28,814 --> 02:43:32,215
and eating your breakfast mindfully, 

1362
02:43:32,264 --> 02:43:34,380
although you do not think about it, 

1363
02:43:34,430 --> 02:43:38,604
but your store consciousness continues to work on it. 

1364
02:43:38,654 --> 02:43:42,805
You have to rely on your store consciousness. 

1365
02:43:42,854 --> 02:43:47,155
If one day you can invent something, 

1366
02:43:47,204 --> 02:43:51,825
that is the work of store consciousness. 

1367
02:43:51,875 --> 02:43:58,680
And many famous scientists have reported that their insight came, 

1368
02:43:58,729 --> 02:44:03,100
when they did not think.

1369
02:44:03,899 --> 02:44:06,439
Thank you.

1370
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:11,264
Thay, here, my name is Ming. 

1371
02:44:11,314 --> 02:44:13,674
I don't do anything and I hope to do even 

1372
02:44:13,724 --> 02:44:15,880
less when I grow up. 

1373
02:44:16,290 --> 02:44:18,899
My question for you: 

1374
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:22,935
For me, you are a simple perfection, 

1375
02:44:22,985 --> 02:44:25,654
as a practitioner - in my opinion, 

1376
02:44:25,704 --> 02:44:27,619
and I find that very inspiring. 

1377
02:44:27,670 --> 02:44:31,920
But ironically, I find most inspiring, 

1378
02:44:31,970 --> 02:44:34,075
when you are not perfect. 

1379
02:44:34,125 --> 02:44:36,494
And the example of that is: 

1380
02:44:36,545 --> 02:44:38,450
I read in your books somewhere, 

1381
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:39,850
that there was a moment, 

1382
02:44:39,899 --> 02:44:42,540
when you got angry at somebody, and than 

1383
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:44,750
you got almost so angry, 

1384
02:44:44,799 --> 02:44:46,540
you almost wanted to stand up and shoot the guy, 

1385
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:50,579
but you didn't, because you are a symbol of peace. 

1386
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:56,194
And I found that very inspiring, because to me I said: 

1387
02:44:56,244 --> 02:44:58,319
even Thich Nhat Hanh has anger. 

1388
02:44:58,369 --> 02:45:02,514
And so my question is, 

1389
02:45:02,564 --> 02:45:06,354
I want you to talk a little bit about your imperfection. 

1390
02:45:06,404 --> 02:45:10,610
And hopefully your imperfection will inspire all of us.

1391
02:45:11,639 --> 02:45:15,709
This is a very important question. 

1392
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:22,979
The problem of happiness and suffering, 

1393
02:45:23,329 --> 02:45:30,369
the problem of perfection and non-perfection is the same. 

1394
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:45,260
When I speak about the kingdom of god, I say that: 

1395
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:49,295
the kingdom of god is not a place, 

1396
02:45:49,344 --> 02:45:52,454
where there is no suffering, to me. 

1397
02:45:52,505 --> 02:45:54,600
Because many people believe, 

1398
02:45:54,649 --> 02:45:56,715
that the kingdom of god should be a place, 

1399
02:45:56,764 --> 02:45:59,049
where there is no suffering. 

1400
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:06,180
But according to this teaching and practise, 

1401
02:46:06,229 --> 02:46:11,049
if there is no suffering, there will be no happiness. 

1402
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:15,790
It is like, when you grow a lotus flower, you need the mud. 

1403
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,439
If there is no mud, there is no lotus. 

1404
02:46:20,489 --> 02:46:27,360
So happiness is made of, we all know that, 

1405
02:46:27,409 --> 02:46:32,395
when you are happy, it means that you have understanding, 

1406
02:46:32,444 --> 02:46:34,400
love, and compassion. 

1407
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:37,610
Without understanding and compassion, 

1408
02:46:37,659 --> 02:46:40,650
you cannot be a happy person. 

1409
02:46:40,700 --> 02:46:47,100
And understanding and compassion arise only out of suffering. 

1410
02:46:48,569 --> 02:46:53,799
When you begin to see the suffering in someone, 

1411
02:46:54,340 --> 02:46:59,760
and when you see that that person is helpless, 

1412
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:03,590
he does not know how to handle suffering inside of him, 

1413
02:47:03,639 --> 02:47:06,635
he is a victim of his suffering and he 

1414
02:47:06,684 --> 02:47:10,569
make people around him suffer, including you. 

1415
02:47:10,619 --> 02:47:14,659
The moment when you begin to see that truth, 

1416
02:47:14,709 --> 02:47:18,104
and understand the suffering in that person, 

1417
02:47:18,154 --> 02:47:21,315
compassion arises in you. 

1418
02:47:21,364 --> 02:47:28,295
Understanding brings about love and compassion. 

1419
02:47:28,344 --> 02:47:31,814
And when you have compassion, 

1420
02:47:31,864 --> 02:47:34,755
you don't want to punish him anymore. 

1421
02:47:34,805 --> 02:47:39,190
Before that, you suffer, you are angry, 

1422
02:47:39,239 --> 02:47:42,670
but now because you have seen the suffering, 

1423
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:45,075
you have understood the suffering, 

1424
02:47:45,125 --> 02:47:50,375
you are motivated by the desire to help him to suffer less. 

1425
02:47:50,424 --> 02:47:57,005
It means that you have made use of the suffering, 

1426
02:47:57,055 --> 02:48:04,994
in order to create understanding and compassion. 

1427
02:48:05,045 --> 02:48:08,950
We know that, without understanding and compassion, 

1428
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,130
no happiness is possible. 

1429
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:17,264
That is why, we know also, 

1430
02:48:17,314 --> 02:48:20,315
that in the kingdom of god there is suffering. 

1431
02:48:20,364 --> 02:48:23,420
Where there is no suffering, no mud, 

1432
02:48:23,470 --> 02:48:25,255
there is no lotus flower. 

1433
02:48:25,305 --> 02:48:27,600
Where there is no suffering, 

1434
02:48:27,649 --> 02:48:30,709
there will be no understanding and compassion.

1435
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:33,755
So my definition of the kingdom of god is: 

1436
02:48:33,805 --> 02:48:36,950
the place where people know how to make 

1437
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,065
good use of suffering, 

1438
02:48:39,114 --> 02:48:42,810
in order to create understanding and compassion. 

1439
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:45,935
It is like if we know how 

1440
02:48:45,985 --> 02:48:48,424
to make good use of the mud in order to 

1441
02:48:48,474 --> 02:48:50,725
produce beautiful lotus flowers. 

1442
02:48:50,774 --> 02:48:55,584
So happiness and suffering they lean on 

1443
02:48:55,634 --> 02:48:58,200
each other to manifest. 

1444
02:48:58,790 --> 02:49:03,729
Anger is a kind of mud. 

1445
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:08,805
Despair is a kind of mud. 

1446
02:49:08,854 --> 02:49:13,025
And if you allow that mud to overwhelm you - 

1447
02:49:13,075 --> 02:49:14,250
well - you suffer. 

1448
02:49:14,299 --> 02:49:16,424
But if you know the practise, 

1449
02:49:16,475 --> 02:49:21,950
and then you can make good use of anger, 

1450
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,229
and despair, in order to create peace and happiness. 

1451
02:49:27,279 --> 02:49:30,560
As a organic gardener, 

1452
02:49:30,610 --> 02:49:34,850
you know how to make good use of the garbage. 

1453
02:49:34,899 --> 02:49:38,970
You can create compost from the garbage, 

1454
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:42,829
in order to nourish flowers and vegetables.

1455
02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:50,329
The same thing is true with suffering and happiness. 

1456
02:49:52,799 --> 02:50:00,229
Thanks to the fact that you have suffered, 

1457
02:50:00,299 --> 02:50:05,215
that you have ingredients in order to make happiness. 

1458
02:50:05,264 --> 02:50:09,739
Looking embracing, looking deeply at that suffering, 

1459
02:50:09,790 --> 02:50:11,799
embracing deeply that suffering, 

1460
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:21,409
understanding arise, and you can create joy and happiness. 

1461
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:32,399
That is why suffering plays a role in the making of happiness. 

1462
02:50:33,659 --> 02:50:37,674
What is wrong with the practise is that, 

1463
02:50:37,725 --> 02:50:39,430
when suffering is there, 

1464
02:50:39,479 --> 02:50:42,110
and if you do not know how to handle suffering, 

1465
02:50:42,159 --> 02:50:43,239
that is wrong. 

1466
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:46,600
But it is not wrong to have suffering. 

1467
02:50:46,649 --> 02:50:48,045
To have suffering, 

1468
02:50:48,094 --> 02:50:52,860
and if you know how to make good use of the suffering, 

1469
02:50:52,909 --> 02:50:57,130
in order to create happiness, that is something good. 

1470
02:50:57,180 --> 02:51:00,069
So we you have to distinguish between 

1471
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:08,404
good practise and bad practise. 

1472
02:51:08,454 --> 02:51:14,510
If it is normal that a human being has craving, 

1473
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:20,264
has anger, has frustration, worries. 

1474
02:51:20,314 --> 02:51:24,204
But if that human being knows the practise of mindfulness, 

1475
02:51:24,255 --> 02:51:28,854
he or she will be able to make good use of that, 

1476
02:51:28,904 --> 02:51:30,779
and transform it into something else, 

1477
02:51:30,829 --> 02:51:33,405
like peace and understanding. 

1478
02:51:33,454 --> 02:51:38,090
So without suffering, without having anger, 

1479
02:51:38,139 --> 02:51:48,049
and sadness, and despair, how could you create peace, 

1480
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:50,889
happiness and non-fear?

1481
02:51:51,079 --> 02:51:54,130
It is like the left and the right. 

1482
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:58,760
If the left is not there, the right can not be there. 

1483
02:51:58,809 --> 02:52:02,274
And if politically you are on the left, 

1484
02:52:02,325 --> 02:52:06,424
you should not try to make the right disappear, 

1485
02:52:06,475 --> 02:52:08,040
because if the right disappears, 

1486
02:52:08,090 --> 02:52:10,184
you disappear at the same time. 

1487
02:52:10,235 --> 02:52:12,470
So we should that have that 

1488
02:52:12,639 --> 02:52:17,475
non-dualistic way of looking at things. 

1489
02:52:17,524 --> 02:52:23,709
It is because you have anger, despair, 

1490
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:24,865
suffering, 

1491
02:52:24,915 --> 02:52:28,795
that you have a chance to transform them 

1492
02:52:28,845 --> 02:52:33,619
into something better, peace, happiness and love.

1493
02:52:39,069 --> 02:52:41,204
Thay, hello. 

1494
02:52:41,255 --> 02:52:42,275
Thanks for being here. 

1495
02:52:42,325 --> 02:52:46,825
I as a person who has struggled with depression in the past, 

1496
02:52:46,875 --> 02:52:49,799
so I am wondering if you have anything in particular to say 

1497
02:52:49,849 --> 02:52:51,875
about mental illnesses, 

1498
02:52:51,924 --> 02:52:54,725
and how mindfulness can play a role 

1499
02:52:54,774 --> 02:52:57,979
in helping people who struggle with that. 

1500
02:52:58,029 --> 02:52:59,649
Thanks.

1501
02:53:02,299 --> 02:53:07,314
Mental illness is like another kind of illness. 

1502
02:53:07,364 --> 02:53:10,639
They have their roots. 

1503
02:53:11,689 --> 02:53:16,060
Suppose we speak of a depression. 

1504
02:53:19,310 --> 02:53:23,475
Depression does not come by itself alone. 

1505
02:53:23,524 --> 02:53:26,784
If we look deeply into the depression, 

1506
02:53:26,834 --> 02:53:30,590
we see the roots of depression. 

1507
02:53:30,700 --> 02:53:33,045
The Buddha said that: 

1508
02:53:33,095 --> 02:53:36,799
Nothing can survive without foot.

1509
02:53:37,819 --> 02:53:43,654
Your love, no matter how beautiful your love is, 

1510
02:53:43,704 --> 02:53:46,825
if you do not know how to nourish your love, 

1511
02:53:46,875 --> 02:53:48,049
to feed your love, 

1512
02:53:48,099 --> 02:53:51,465
it will turn to be something else latter on, 

1513
02:53:51,514 --> 02:53:53,314
like hate and anger. 

1514
02:53:53,364 --> 02:53:56,389
So love needs foot. 

1515
02:53:56,439 --> 02:53:58,659
Suffering also. 

1516
02:53:58,709 --> 02:54:05,000
Your depression also needs foot in order to be alive.

1517
02:54:05,049 --> 02:54:07,819
We have lived in such a way, 

1518
02:54:07,869 --> 02:54:10,380
we have consumed in such a way, 

1519
02:54:10,430 --> 02:54:15,475
that make depression possible in the present moment. 

1520
02:54:15,524 --> 02:54:21,174
The way we have lived our daily life, 

1521
02:54:21,225 --> 02:54:23,725
in the last 6 months for instance, 

1522
02:54:23,774 --> 02:54:26,645
the kind of nutriments we have got, 

1523
02:54:26,694 --> 02:54:30,150
like fear, anger, despair, 

1524
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:33,954
and we do not know how handle these. 

1525
02:54:34,005 --> 02:54:37,954
We have allowed them to be accumulated for a long time, 

1526
02:54:38,005 --> 02:54:41,994
that is why the depression has become a reality. 

1527
02:54:42,045 --> 02:54:44,354
The Buddha said that: 

1528
02:54:44,404 --> 02:54:48,220
What has come to be there, 

1529
02:54:48,270 --> 02:54:50,639
if you know how to look deeply, 

1530
02:54:50,689 --> 02:54:53,895
and to identify the source of foot, 

1531
02:54:53,944 --> 02:54:55,170
the source of nutriment, that has brought it 

1532
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:57,700
in, 

1533
02:54:58,090 --> 02:55:02,215
after you have seen the roots and the 

1534
02:55:02,264 --> 02:55:07,659
source of nutriment of what has come to be, 

1535
02:55:07,709 --> 02:55:10,865
you already begin on your path 

1536
02:55:10,915 --> 02:55:13,340
of transformation and healing. 

1537
02:55:13,389 --> 02:55:19,270
Because if you know how to identify that kind of nutriment, 

1538
02:55:19,319 --> 02:55:25,485
that have brought your depression, 

1539
02:55:25,534 --> 02:55:31,755
you know how to cut that source of nutriments. 

1540
02:55:31,805 --> 02:55:36,889
And if you stop consuming that kind of nutriment, 

1541
02:55:36,939 --> 02:55:39,819
you deprive your depression of foot, 

1542
02:55:39,869 --> 02:55:45,135
and your depression will have to die in a few weeks, 

1543
02:55:45,184 --> 02:55:46,784
or in a few months. 

1544
02:55:46,834 --> 02:55:54,060
So that is why learning the art of mindful living, 

1545
02:55:54,110 --> 02:56:00,920
we will not continue to ingest the kind of foot, 

1546
02:56:00,970 --> 02:56:02,819
that we have.

1547
02:56:02,950 --> 02:56:07,454
The Buddha spoke about 4 kinds of nutriments (Āhāra Sutta):

1548
02:56:07,504 --> 02:56:09,334
edible food,

1549
02:56:09,385 --> 02:56:12,244
sense impressions, 

1550
02:56:12,295 --> 02:56:17,005
the kind of food that you consume not by the mouth, 

1551
02:56:17,055 --> 02:56:22,100
but by eyes, ear and mind. 

1552
02:56:22,149 --> 02:56:24,704
There are many toxic things that we consume 

1553
02:56:24,754 --> 02:56:26,694
in our daily life.

1554
02:56:26,744 --> 02:56:31,595
And the 3. kind of food is volition. 

1555
02:56:31,645 --> 02:56:36,825
Your deepest desire, your deepest intention, is the food.

1556
02:56:36,875 --> 02:56:40,385
And also the 4. kind of nutriment, 

1557
02:56:40,434 --> 02:56:42,505
which is collective consciousness. 

1558
02:56:42,555 --> 02:56:44,250
If you live in a place, 

1559
02:56:44,299 --> 02:56:46,900
where there is a kind of collective energy of fear, 

1560
02:56:46,950 --> 02:56:50,450
anger, craving, hate, you consume.

1561
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:56,189
That is why refraining from consuming 

1562
02:56:56,500 --> 02:57:00,970
nutriments that are toxic, 

1563
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:08,619
you deprive your depression of foot, 

1564
02:57:08,670 --> 02:57:15,954
and your depression will have to die in a few weeks. 

1565
02:57:16,005 --> 02:57:24,635
That is why all mental illness are like that also. 

1566
02:57:24,685 --> 02:57:29,704
We have allowed ourselves to in the toxic environment. 

1567
02:57:29,754 --> 02:57:33,299
We have allowed ourselves to consume items, 

1568
02:57:33,350 --> 02:57:38,049
that contain craving, anger, fear, despair, 

1569
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:45,479
that is why these symptoms of mental illness have appeared. 

1570
02:57:45,529 --> 02:57:49,490
And the way we deal with our sickness: 

1571
02:57:49,540 --> 02:57:52,420
we try to suppress them. 

1572
02:57:52,470 --> 02:57:56,909
When the suffering comes up, 

1573
02:57:56,959 --> 02:57:59,779
we do not allow them to come up, 

1574
02:57:59,829 --> 02:58:04,495
we try to suppress them, by the way of consuming, 

1575
02:58:04,545 --> 02:58:06,385
we want to cover them up. 

1576
02:58:06,434 --> 02:58:10,770
And we create a situation of bad circulation 

1577
02:58:10,819 --> 02:58:12,415
in our consciousness. 

1578
02:58:12,465 --> 02:58:18,635
And that is why symptoms of mental illness begin to appear. 

1579
02:58:18,685 --> 02:58:21,590
But if you know how to practise mindfulness:


1580
02:58:21,639 --> 02:58:24,439
you allow the pain the come up,

1581
02:58:24,489 --> 02:58:26,860
and you embrace tenderly your pain,

1582
02:58:26,909 --> 02:58:27,834
and recognise it,

1583
02:58:27,885 --> 02:58:30,329
and look into it. 

1584
02:58:30,380 --> 02:58:33,295
And than your pain will 

1585
02:58:33,344 --> 02:58:36,435
be embraced by that energy of mindfulness, 

1586
02:58:36,485 --> 02:58:42,295
concentration, compassion, and will go down, 

1587
02:58:42,345 --> 02:58:44,475
losing some of its strength.

1588
02:58:44,524 --> 02:58:46,250
And next time when it comes up, 

1589
02:58:46,299 --> 02:58:47,720
you allow it to come up, 

1590
02:58:47,770 --> 02:58:52,935
because you know how to handle it, handling the pain.

1591
02:58:52,985 --> 02:58:56,639
And after a few weeks of practising like that, 

1592
02:58:56,689 --> 02:58:58,549
you create, 

1593
02:58:58,599 --> 02:59:02,310
you restore a state of good circulation 

1594
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:04,290
in your consciousness. 

1595
02:59:04,350 --> 02:59:11,935
And the symptoms of mental illness will begin to disappear.

1596
02:59:11,985 --> 02:59:16,869
And that is why the practise of mindfulness can be very healing. 

1597
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:21,010
Physically and also mentally.

1598
02:59:32,270 --> 02:59:43,100
[Gong]

1599
02:59:43,270 --> 02:59:45,565
Thank you so much for coming, 

1600
02:59:45,614 --> 02:59:47,915
and reminding us how easy it can be, 

1601
02:59:47,965 --> 02:59:51,470
to be happy and peaceful and loving. 

1602
02:59:51,779 --> 02:59:54,435
My question follows on something, 

1603
02:59:54,485 --> 02:59:56,225
that you said early on, 

1604
02:59:56,274 --> 03:00:00,345
regarding meditation as a combination of mindfulness, 

1605
03:00:00,395 --> 03:00:03,610
concentration, and then insight that arises. 

1606
03:00:03,659 --> 03:00:06,215
My question is about the insight. 

1607
03:00:06,264 --> 03:00:10,299
Having achieved an insight through meditation, 

1608
03:00:10,349 --> 03:00:14,944
does one expend effort to act on that insight, 

1609
03:00:14,994 --> 03:00:18,235
or does one simply hold the insight in mind, 

1610
03:00:18,284 --> 03:00:20,435
and allow this natural circulation that 

1611
03:00:20,485 --> 03:00:24,970
you speak of to transform the mind?

1612
03:00:30,299 --> 03:00:36,459
Insight can be maintained and nourished. 

1613
03:00:36,630 --> 03:00:48,180
Like insight can come just in the present moment. 

1614
03:00:48,229 --> 03:00:54,854
Like in the exercise of mindful breathing: 

1615
03:00:54,904 --> 03:00:58,565
Breathing in, I feel alive.

1616
03:00:58,614 --> 03:01:03,534
So you touch the insight, that you are alive. 

1617
03:01:03,584 --> 03:01:08,084
And to be alive is a miracle. 

1618
03:01:08,135 --> 03:01:10,595
And that is why, when you breath out, 

1619
03:01:10,645 --> 03:01:13,935
you can enjoy, you can be happy, 

1620
03:01:13,985 --> 03:01:17,970
you can celebrate the fact that you are alive. 

1621
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:22,049
But the practise of concentration 

1622
03:01:22,099 --> 03:01:24,850
can keep the insight alive. 

1623
03:01:24,899 --> 03:01:30,920
And if the insight is alive, happiness continues to be. 

1624
03:01:30,979 --> 03:01:36,725
If you allow the insight to go away, 

1625
03:01:36,774 --> 03:01:39,334
your happiness may go away also.

1626
03:01:39,384 --> 03:01:44,514
It is like the insight of inter-being. 

1627
03:01:44,564 --> 03:01:47,784
A father, looking deeply into his son, 

1628
03:01:47,834 --> 03:01:54,049
sees that he is fully present in every cell of his son. 

1629
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:57,360
And if the son looks into himself, 

1630
03:01:57,409 --> 03:02:01,704
he can see that in every cell of his body, 

1631
03:02:01,755 --> 03:02:05,430
his father is fully present. 

1632
03:02:05,479 --> 03:02:11,424
And he gets the insight of father and son inter-are. 

1633
03:02:11,475 --> 03:02:15,450
You cannot remove father from son. 

1634
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:18,810
You cannot remove son from father. 

1635
03:02:18,860 --> 03:02:22,170
That is the insight of inter-being. 

1636
03:02:22,299 --> 03:02:24,604
And when the insight 

1637
03:02:24,654 --> 03:02:28,125
of inter-being between son and father is alive, 

1638
03:02:28,174 --> 03:02:31,215
anger is impossible, 

1639
03:02:31,264 --> 03:02:34,255
because when you get angry at your father, 

1640
03:02:34,305 --> 03:02:36,795
you get angry at yourself. 

1641
03:02:36,845 --> 03:02:39,889
You are a continuation of your father. 

1642
03:02:39,939 --> 03:02:43,314
If there is a young men, who says that: 

1643
03:02:43,364 --> 03:02:44,935
I hate my father. 

1644
03:02:44,985 --> 03:02:50,020
I don't want to have anything to do with that person.

1645
03:02:50,069 --> 03:02:54,284
It means that that young man does not 

1646
03:02:54,334 --> 03:02:56,215
have the insight of inter-being. 

1647
03:02:56,264 --> 03:02:59,364
He does not know that his father is in him, 

1648
03:02:59,415 --> 03:03:02,915
and it is impossible to remove his father from him. 

1649
03:03:02,965 --> 03:03:07,600
If he removes his father from him, he is no longer there. 

1650
03:03:07,649 --> 03:03:12,174
And if that insight is in him, 

1651
03:03:12,224 --> 03:03:17,340
he knows that he has to reconcile with his father in him. 

1652
03:03:17,389 --> 03:03:20,604
Because to say that: 

1653
03:03:20,654 --> 03:03:24,034
I do not want to have anything to do with that person.

1654
03:03:24,084 --> 03:03:28,764
is nonsense, because you are his continuation, you are him. 

1655
03:03:28,814 --> 03:03:31,525
How can you say that you do not have 

1656
03:03:31,575 --> 03:03:33,744
anything to do with him? 

1657
03:03:33,795 --> 03:03:38,274
To say that means you do not have the insight of inter-being. 

1658
03:03:38,325 --> 03:03:41,329
And the insight of inter-being not 

1659
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:44,295
only liberates you from suffering, 

1660
03:03:44,345 --> 03:03:47,619
but shows you the way to behave, 

1661
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:52,494
in order for harmony, for love, 

1662
03:03:52,545 --> 03:03:55,909
for happiness to be possible.

1663
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:16,405
[Gong]

1664
03:04:16,454 --> 03:04:17,614
Hello. 

1665
03:04:17,665 --> 03:04:22,590
Thank you very much for your tender and conscious comments. 

1666
03:04:22,639 --> 03:04:25,034
One of the things, one of my passions, 

1667
03:04:25,084 --> 03:04:26,395
is working with children. 

1668
03:04:26,444 --> 03:04:28,310
And I had the opportunity to be in 

1669
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:30,869
India last year working with small children. 

1670
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:33,315
And I was amazed at how, 

1671
03:04:33,364 --> 03:04:35,040
no matter what they have been through, 

1672
03:04:35,090 --> 03:04:37,375
they had this joy, and this compassion, 

1673
03:04:37,424 --> 03:04:39,600
and feeling of connection with community, 

1674
03:04:39,649 --> 03:04:42,159
even to the point, where they would write on our hands: 

1675
03:04:42,209 --> 03:04:45,155
When the world gives you a 1000 reasons to cry, 

1676
03:04:45,204 --> 03:04:47,954
show the world you have a million reasons to smile.

1677
03:04:48,005 --> 03:04:49,534
And I found it so beautiful. 

1678
03:04:49,584 --> 03:04:52,875
One of the thing I do is work with children in yoga, 

1679
03:04:52,924 --> 03:04:55,239
and visualisation, and creative play, 

1680
03:04:55,290 --> 03:04:56,545
and I find children in our 

1681
03:04:56,594 --> 03:05:00,284
community are already starting to multitask, 

1682
03:05:00,334 --> 03:05:02,584
and looking at the digital community, 

1683
03:05:02,634 --> 03:05:05,814
and getting very fragmented in minds. 

1684
03:05:05,864 --> 03:05:07,745
And one thing that I find works very very 

1685
03:05:07,795 --> 03:05:09,750
well is teaching through stories. 

1686
03:05:09,799 --> 03:05:12,139
And I was wondering if you had a sweet story, 

1687
03:05:12,189 --> 03:05:13,860
that we may be able to share, 

1688
03:05:13,909 --> 03:05:15,235
even with our own children, 

1689
03:05:15,284 --> 03:05:18,275
helping to illustrate the power of mindfulness, 

1690
03:05:18,325 --> 03:05:22,060
or joy, compassion, maybe one of your favourites.

1691
03:05:37,010 --> 03:05:39,345
When I was small, 

1692
03:05:39,395 --> 03:05:43,604
I saw the drawing of a Buddha on the cover 

1693
03:05:43,654 --> 03:05:45,064
of a Buddhist magazine. 

1694
03:05:45,114 --> 03:05:47,420
The Buddha was sitting on the grass, 

1695
03:05:47,470 --> 03:05:54,154
very peaceful, very happy. 

1696
03:05:54,204 --> 03:05:59,900
And I wished I can be someone like him, 

1697
03:05:59,950 --> 03:06:05,909
because around me people are nervous, unhappy. 

1698
03:06:05,959 --> 03:06:13,899
So the first time, when my school organised an outing, 

1699
03:06:13,950 --> 03:06:22,534
climbing a mountain, I was very excited, 

1700
03:06:22,584 --> 03:06:25,369
because we learned that there was a hermit 

1701
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:30,389
practising on the mountain in order to become a Buddha. 

1702
03:06:31,510 --> 03:06:34,485
I had not seen a hermit before, 

1703
03:06:34,534 --> 03:06:38,985
so I was very enthusiastic climbing. 

1704
03:06:39,034 --> 03:06:44,869
And we were organised in groups of 5 boys and of 5 girls. 

1705
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:49,180
And many hundreds of us where climbing the mountains. 

1706
03:06:49,229 --> 03:06:52,255
We did not know how to practise walking meditation. 

1707
03:06:52,305 --> 03:06:56,920
We tried to climb as quickly as possible. 

1708
03:06:56,969 --> 03:07:00,290
And half the way, we drank all our water. 

1709
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:02,235
We were very thirsty, 

1710
03:07:02,284 --> 03:07:05,700
when we came to the top of the mountain. 

1711
03:07:05,750 --> 03:07:08,405
And the worst thing was, that I learned, 

1712
03:07:08,454 --> 03:07:11,579
that the hermit was not there. 

1713
03:07:13,950 --> 03:07:20,700
Perhaps he has heard that 500 students are coming. 

1714
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:24,465
It is not quiet enough for him, so he, 

1715
03:07:24,514 --> 03:07:31,314
maybe he had hidden himself somewhere in the mountain. 

1716
03:07:31,364 --> 03:07:34,420
So when we were given the order 

1717
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:38,970
to display our pick-nick and eat, 

1718
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:42,180
I alone ventured in the wood, 

1719
03:07:42,229 --> 03:07:47,329
hoping that I can see the hermit. 

1720
03:07:47,950 --> 03:07:52,084
And I hear the sound of water dripping, 

1721
03:07:52,134 --> 03:07:57,784
and I followed, and I discovered a very beautiful natural well. 

1722
03:07:57,834 --> 03:08:00,810
The water was very limpid. 

1723
03:08:00,860 --> 03:08:04,215
And you know that I was very thirsty. 

1724
03:08:04,264 --> 03:08:07,514
I am so happy, I kneeled down, 

1725
03:08:07,564 --> 03:08:11,100
and cup the water, and drink. 

1726
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:17,170
And suddenly a thought came to me: 

1727
03:08:17,389 --> 03:08:23,854
I believed that the hermit has transformed himself into a well. 

1728
03:08:23,904 --> 03:08:30,530
So that I can have a private audience with him. 

1729
03:08:30,579 --> 03:08:33,409
And when you are small, 

1730
03:08:33,459 --> 03:08:37,614
and when you have read many fairy-tales, 

1731
03:08:37,665 --> 03:08:40,534
you believe things like that. 

1732
03:08:40,584 --> 03:08:45,674
And after I have drunk the water, 

1733
03:08:45,724 --> 03:08:51,709
I felt so peaceful, so happy, so fulfilled, 

1734
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:57,799
that I did not feel any desire at all. 

1735
03:08:58,020 --> 03:09:03,529
Even the desire to meet the hermit as a person. 

1736
03:09:03,579 --> 03:09:07,090
And as I was very tired, I lay down, 

1737
03:09:07,139 --> 03:09:10,784
and I felt into a very deep sleep. 

1738
03:09:10,834 --> 03:09:14,215
I did not know how many minutes I slept, 

1739
03:09:14,264 --> 03:09:17,569
but when I woke up, I did not know where I were. 

1740
03:09:17,619 --> 03:09:19,565
It took time to remember, 

1741
03:09:19,614 --> 03:09:22,149
that the other boys were waiting for me. 

1742
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:25,319
I left the place with a lot of regret. 

1743
03:09:25,369 --> 03:09:33,545
And I had to leave my beloved well and to go down. 

1744
03:09:33,594 --> 03:09:38,514
And in my mind, there is a sentence coming up: 

1745
03:09:38,564 --> 03:09:43,959
I have drunk the most delicious water in the world. 

1746
03:09:44,479 --> 03:09:49,360
And when I were back with the other children, 

1747
03:09:49,909 --> 03:09:53,715
I did not have the intention to tell them the story, 

1748
03:09:53,764 --> 03:10:01,209
that I have met the hermit in the form of a well. 

1749
03:10:02,450 --> 03:10:08,989
It sounds like, if I tell them - well - I lose something. 

1750
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:14,395
My experience was kind deep spiritual experience, 

1751
03:10:14,444 --> 03:10:19,250
I wanted to keep by myself, to keep it long. 

1752
03:10:19,299 --> 03:10:28,135
And later on, when I grew up, I had the hope, that everyone I meet will have the chance to 

1753
03:10:28,184 --> 03:10:31,104
that everyone I meet will have the chance to 

1754
03:10:31,154 --> 03:10:36,970
meet his hermit also in their lifetime. 

1755
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:39,829
Maybe you have met your hermit, 

1756
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:42,159
but you have not recognised him. 

1757
03:10:42,209 --> 03:10:44,670
Your hermit may not be a well, 

1758
03:10:44,720 --> 03:10:51,065
but may be a rock, or a tree, or a child, or a mountain. 

1759
03:10:51,114 --> 03:10:54,815
But once you have got the hermit, you know where to go. 

1760
03:10:54,864 --> 03:10:57,005
And you begin your spiritual life, 

1761
03:10:57,055 --> 03:11:02,014
that can help you to overcome difficulties and find peace. 

1762
03:11:02,064 --> 03:11:06,525
And that is one of the stories I like to tell children, 

1763
03:11:06,575 --> 03:11:09,790
who come to Plum Village to practise.

1764
03:11:14,450 --> 03:11:16,549
Thank you very much.

1766
03:11:17,549 --> 03:11:21,549
