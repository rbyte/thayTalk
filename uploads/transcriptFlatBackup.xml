</span><ol><li><span end="5487.49" start="5482.37">The 1. element of true love is <b>loving kindness, Maitrī</b>. </span><span end="5493.16" start="5489.44">That is the capacity to make another person happy. </span><span end="5498.61" start="5496.49">And we have already learned that, </span><span end="5502.72" start="5500.14">if we cannot make ourselves peaceful, </span><span end="5506.83" start="5502.81">fresh, and happy, we cannot make another person happy. </span><span end="5512.58" start="5508.42">The practise of mindfulness helps restore solidity, </span><span end="5516.65" start="5513.31">freedom, piece, and freshness to us, </span><span end="5518.65" start="5517.64">so that we can, </span><span end="5523.11" start="5520">we have the capacity to make the other person happy.</span></li>
<li><span end="5530.93" start="5524.54">The 2. element of true love is <b>compassion, Karuṇā</b>. </span><span end="5535.85" start="5532.38">That capacity of understanding the suffering </span><span end="5538.32" start="5536.58">and help remove it. </span><span end="5540.26" start="5539.29">If you love someone, </span><span end="5543.73" start="5541.12">you should understand the suffering in him or in her, </span><span end="5548.75" start="5544.87">and you should be able to help transform that, remove that. </span><span end="5554.14" start="5551.16">And that you can do only after you have done it for you. </span><span end="5557.94" start="5555.29">You have fear, anger, despair in you, </span><span end="5561.01" start="5558.21">and if you do not know how to transform it, </span><span end="5563.89" start="5561.41">how can you help your beloved one to do the same? </span><span end="5567.44" start="5564.99">So understanding the suffering inside, </span><span end="5571.46" start="5568.9">and bring a relief and transformation, </span><span end="5572.88" start="5571.55">is very crucial for love. </span><span end="5577.15" start="5574.23">And then you will be able to help your beloved one </span><span end="5581.56" start="5579.44">transform the suffering. </span><span end="5586.18" start="5583.93">So that is the 2. element of true love: </span><span end="5593.37" start="5588.92">the capacity to help someone suffer less.</span></li>
<li><span end="5600.69" start="5597.15">And the 3. element of true love is <b>joy</b> (<b>Muditā</b>), </span><span end="5606.39" start="5601.35">because true love always generate joy for you </span><span end="5607.78" start="5606.5">and for the other person. </span><span end="5614.59" start="5609.37">If both of us cry during the process of loving, </span><span end="5615.73" start="5614.7">that is not true love. </span><span end="5621.33" start="5616.77">True love should bring joy every moment of our daily life. </span><span end="5628.11" start="5622.52">And mindfulness can help doing that.</span></li>
<li><span end="5636.72" start="5630.44">And the 4. element of true love is <b>inclusiveness</b> (<b>Upekṣā</b>). </span><span end="5638.78" start="5637.96">In true love, </span><span end="5641.67" start="5639.65">there is no longer any frontier between </span><span end="5643.24" start="5641.67">you and your beloved one. </span><span end="5646.04" start="5644.14">Your suffering is his suffering. </span><span end="5650.08" start="5647.67">His happiness is your happiness. </span><span end="5656.45" start="5652.89">And there is a perfect way of understanding </span><span end="5657.75" start="5656.51">between the two of you. </span><span end="5662.93" start="5659.36">And together you can serve and help many people. </span><span end="5667.6" start="5663.93">True love is the kind of love that always grows. </span><span end="5671.67" start="5670.56">It has no frontier. </span><span end="5674.69" start="5673.31">And practising true love, </span><span end="5683.25" start="5676.45">you begin to <i>embrace everyone</i>, the whole planet, </span><span end="5685.97" start="5684.18">and bring a lot of joy to you.</span></li></ol>
<span end="5691.19" start="5687.86">And that is why we have to know where we go. </span><span end="5696.02" start="5694.09">If love is our destination, </span><span end="5699.47" start="5696.52">and then we have to <b>sacrifice other things</b>, </span><span end="5701.58" start="5699.55">that are not love, like:

<span end="5712.11" start="5710.92">Because there are those, </span><span end="5716.42" start="5712.11">who have plenty of these things, and who suffer very deeply.</span><br />

<span end="5730.04" start="5721.83">And when I was ordained as a monk at the age of 16, </span><span end="5735.68" start="5732.93">my teacher gave me the <b>Dharma name</b><b>: </b></span><span end="5737.18" start="5735.72"><span><b>Nhất Hạnh</b></span>, which means: </span><span end="5740.79" start="5738.58"><i>one action</i> - you do only one thing. </span><span end="5748.42" start="5742.76">You don't do many things at the same time - <b>mono-tasking</b>. </span><span end="5760.56" start="5755.6">And I tried to live according to this teaching. </span><span end="5765.05" start="5762.96">I want to transform myself. </span><span end="5768.24" start="5766.67">I want to help people be happy. </span><span end="5772.14" start="5769.9">Because I know that, if people are happy, </span><span end="5773.53" start="5772.17">I can be happy also. </span><span end="5787.31" start="5776.37">And that is why <b>Buddhist meditation is made of 2 elements</b>: </span><span end="5792.08" start="5788.08">the 1. element is <b>concentration</b>. </span><span end="5799.62" start="5796.19">You focus your attention just on one thing. </span><span end="5805.44" start="5803.33">Otherwise your concentration is not </span><span end="5811.68" start="5806.8">powerful enough to get a breakthrough, and get a insight. </span><span end="5816.04" start="5814.77">And concentration can be practised, </span><span end="5821.46" start="5818.03">not by thinking, but by:
