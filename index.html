	<h3>Transcription</h3>
	This is <b>my interpretation</b> of the talk. It is not faithful to the word! I tried instead to find a sensible transcription.
	<ul>
		<li>Stuttering, verbal corrections, errors, and repetitions are reduced to their essence.</li>
		<li>Paragraphs and enumerations structure the talk based on topics and pauses.</li>
		<li>Highlighted in <b>bold</b> are central themes and keywords.</li>
		<li><i>Italics</i> indicate accentuation.</li>
		<li>Quotations and questions from the audience are marked in blue.</li>
		<li>Parentheses contain my annotations.</li>
		<li>British English is used, and serial commas.</li>
	</ul>
